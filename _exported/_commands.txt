count_heartbeats
Mathlib.CountHeartbeats.commandCount_heartbeatsIn__
Mathlib.Util.CountHeartbeats
Count the heartbeats used in the enclosed command.

This is most useful for setting sufficient but reasonable limits via `set_option maxHeartbeats`
for long running declarations.

If you do so, please resist the temptation to set the limit as low as possible.
As the `simp` set and other features of the library evolve,
other contributors will find that their (likely unrelated) changes
have pushed the declaration over the limit.
`count_heartbearts in` will automatically suggest a `set_option maxHeartbeats` via "Try this:"
using the least number of the form `2^k * 200000` that suffices.

Note that that internal heartbeat counter accessible via `IO.getNumHeartbeats`
has granularity 1000 times finer that the limits set by `set_option maxHeartbeats`.
As this is intended as a user command, we divide by 1000.

ImportGraph.Imports
Find locations as high as possible in the import hierarchy

Using `#find_home!` will forcefully remove the current file.
Note that this works best if used in a file with `import Mathlib`.

The current file could still be the only suggestion, even using `#find_home! lemma`.
The reason is that `#find_home!` scans the import graph below the current file,
selects all the files containing declarations appearing in `lemma`, excluding
the current file itself and looks for all least upper bounds of such files.

For a simple example, if `lemma` is in a file importing only `A.lean` and `B.lean` and
uses one lemma from each, then `#find_home! lemma` returns the current file.

Batteries.Tactic.PrintPrefix
The command `#print prefix foo` will print all definitions that start with

For example, the command below will print out definitions in the `List` namespace:

```lean
#print prefix List
```

`#print prefix` can be controlled by flags in `PrintPrefixConfig`.  These provide
options for filtering names and formatting.   For example,
`#print prefix` by default excludes internal names, but this can be controlled
via config:
```lean
#print prefix (config := {internals := true}) List
```

By default, `#print prefix` prints the type after each name.  This can be controlled
by setting `showTypes` to `false`:
```lean
#print prefix (config := {showTypes := false}) List
```

The complete set of flags can be seen in the documentation

Mathlib.Tactic.MkIffOfInductiveProp
`mk_iff_of_inductive_prop i r` makes an `iff` rule for the inductively-defined proposition `i`.
The new rule `r` has the shape `∀ps is, i as ↔ ⋁_j, ∃cs, is = cs`, where `ps` are the type
parameters, `is` are the indices, `j` ranges over all possible constructors, the `cs` are the
parameters for each of the constructors, and the equalities `is = cs` are the instantiations for
each constructor for each of the indices to the inductive type `i`.

In each case, we remove constructor parameters (i.e. `cs`) when the corresponding equality would
be just `c = i` for some index `i`.

For example, `mk_iff_of_inductive_prop` on `List.Chain` produces:

```lean
∀ { α : Type*} (R : α → α → Prop) (a : α) (l : List α),
  Chain R a l ↔ l = [] ∨ ∃(b : α) (l' : List α), R a b ∧ Chain R b l ∧ l = b :: l'

#explode
Mathlib.Explode.«command#explode_»
Mathlib.Tactic.Explode
`#explode expr` displays a proof term in a line-by-line format somewhat akin to a Fitch-style
proof or the Metamath proof style.

For example, exploding the following theorem:

```lean
#explode iff_of_true
```

produces:

```lean
iff_of_true : ∀ {a b : Prop}, a → b → (a ↔ b)

0│         │ a         ├ Prop
1│         │ b         ├ Prop
2│         │ ha        ├ a
3│         │ hb        ├ b
4│         │ x✝        │ ┌ a
5│4,3      │ ∀I        │ a → b
6│         │ x✝        │ ┌ b
7│6,2      │ ∀I        │ b → a
8│5,7      │ Iff.intro │ a ↔ b
9│0,1,2,3,8│ ∀I        │ ∀ {a b : Prop}, a → b → (a ↔ b)
```

## Overview

The `#explode` command takes the body of the theorem and decomposes it into its parts,
displaying each expression constructor one at a time. The constructor is indicated
in some way in column 3, and its dependencies are recorded in column 2.

These are the main constructor types:

  - Lambda expressions (`Expr.lam`). The expression `fun (h : p) => s` is displayed as
    ```lean
     0│    │ h   │ ┌ p
     1│**  │ **  │ │ q
     2│1,2 │ ∀I  │ ∀ (h : p), q
    ```
    with `**` a wildcard, and there can be intervening steps between 0 and 1.
    Nested lambda expressions can be merged, and `∀I` can depend on a whole list of arguments.

  - Applications (`Expr.app`). The expression `f a b c` is displayed as
     ```lean
     0│**      │ f  │ A → B → C → D
     1│**      │ a  │ A
     2│**      │ b  │ B
     3│**      │ c  │ C
     1│0,1,2,3 │ ∀E │ D
     ```
     There can be intervening steps between each of these.
     As a special case, if `f` is a constant it can be omitted and the display instead looks like
     ```lean
     0│**    │ a │ A
     1│**    │ b │ B
     2│**    │ c │ C
     3│1,2,3 │ f │ D
     ```

  - Let expressions (`Expr.letE`) do not display in any special way, but they do
    ensure that in `let x := v; b` that `v` is processed first and then `b`, rather
    than first doing zeta reduction. This keeps lambda merging and application merging
    from making proofs with `let` confusing to interpret.

  - Everything else (constants, fvars, etc.) display `x : X` as
    ```lean
    0│  │ x │ X
    ```

## In more detail

The output of `#explode` is a Fitch-style proof in a four-column diagram modeled after Metamath
proof displays like [this](http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/ru.html). The headers of the columns are
"Step", "Hyp", "Ref", "Type" (or "Expression" in the case of Metamath):
* **Step**: An increasing sequence of numbers for each row in the proof, used in the Hyp fields.
* **Hyp**: The direct children of the current step. These are step numbers for the subexpressions
  for this step's expression. For theorem applications, it's the theorem arguments, and for
  foralls it is all the bound variables and the conclusion.
* **Ref**: The name of the theorem being applied. This is well-defined in Metamath, but in Lean
  there are some special steps that may have long names because the structure of proof terms doesn't
  exactly match this mold.
  * If the theorem is `foo (x y : Z) : A x -> B y -> C x y`:
    * the Ref field will contain `foo`,
    * `x` and `y` will be suppressed, because term construction is not interesting, and
    * the Hyp field will reference steps proving `A x` and `B y`. This corresponds to a proof term
      like `@foo x y pA pB` where `pA` and `pB` are subproofs.
    * In the Hyp column, suppressed terms are omitted, including terms that ought to be
      suppressed but are not (in particular lambda arguments).
      TODO: implement a configuration option to enable representing suppressed terms using
      an `_` rather than a step number.
  * If the head of the proof term is a local constant or lambda, then in this case the Ref will
    say `∀E` for forall-elimination. This happens when you have for example `h : A -> B` and
    `ha : A` and prove `b` by `h ha`; we reinterpret this as if it said `∀E h ha` where `∀E` is
    (n-ary) modus ponens.
  * If the proof term is a lambda, we will also use `∀I` for forall-introduction, referencing the
    body of the lambda. The indentation level will increase, and a bracket will surround the proof
    of the body of the lambda, starting at a proof step labeled with the name of the lambda variable
    and its type, and ending with the `∀I` step. Metamath doesn't have steps like this, but the
    style is based on Fitch proofs in first-order logic.
* **Type**: This contains the type of the proof term, the theorem being proven at the current step.

Also, it is common for a Lean theorem to begin with a sequence of lambdas introducing local
constants of the theorem. In order to minimize the indentation level, the `∀I` steps at the end of
the proof will be introduced in a group and the indentation will stay fixed. (The indentation
brackets are only needed in order to delimit the scope of assumptions, and these assumptions
have global scope anyway so detailed tracking is not necessary.)

#whnf
Conv.«command#whnf_»
Mathlib.Tactic.Conv
The command `#whnf e` evaluates `e` to Weak Head Normal Form, which means that the "head"
of the expression is reduced to a primitive - a lambda or forall, or an axiom or inductive type.
It is similar to `#reduce e`, but it does not reduce the expression completely,
only until the first constructor is exposed. For example:
```
open Nat List
set_option pp.notation false
#whnf [1, 2, 3].map succ
-- cons (succ 1) (map succ (cons 2 (cons 3 nil)))
#reduce [1, 2, 3].map succ
-- cons 2 (cons 3 (cons 4 nil))
```
The head of this expression is the `List.cons` constructor,
so we can see from this much that the list is not empty,
but the subterms `Nat.succ 1` and `List.map Nat.succ (List.cons 2 (List.cons 3 List.nil))` are
still unevaluated. `#reduce` is equivalent to using `#whnf` on every subexpression.

The basic usage is `#norm_num e`, where `e` is an expression,

This accepts the same options as the `#simp` command.
You can specify additional simp lemmas as usual, for example using `#norm_num [f, g] : e`.
(The colon is optional but helpful for the parser.)
The `only` restricts `norm_num` to using only the provided lemmas, and so
`#norm_num only : e` behaves similarly to `norm_num1`.

Unlike `norm_num`, this command does not fail when no simplifications are made.

`#norm_num` understands local variables, so you can use them to introduce parameters.

If there is no alignment for a given definition, mathport will attempt to convert
from the lean 3 `snake_case` style to `UpperCamelCase` for namespaces and types and
`lowerCamelCase` for definitions, and `snake_case` for theorems. But for various reasons,
it may fail either to determine whether it is a type, definition, or theorem, or to determine
that a specific definition is in fact being called. Or a specific definition may need a different
name altogether because the existing name is already taken in lean 4 for something else. For
these reasons, you should use `#align` on any theorem that needs to be renamed from the default.

name component.

It is also possible to specify the module instead with

#help
«command#help_Option___»
Mathlib.Tactic.HelpCmd
The command `#help option` shows all options that have been defined in the current environment.
Each option has a format like:
```
option pp.all : Bool := false
  (pretty printer) display coercions, implicit parameters, proof terms, fully qualified names,
  universe, and disable beta reduction and notations during pretty printing
```
This says that `pp.all` is an option which can be set to a `Bool` value, and the default value is
`false`. If an option has been modified from the default using e.g. `set_option pp.all true`,
it will appear as a `(currently: true)` note next to the option.

The form `#help option id` will show only options that begin with `id`.

variable?
Mathlib.Command.Variable.variable?
Mathlib.Tactic.Variable
The `variable?` command has the same syntax as `variable`, but it will auto-insert
missing instance arguments wherever they are needed.
It does not add variables that can already be deduced from others in the current context.
By default the command checks that variables aren't implied by earlier ones, but it does *not*
check that earlier variables aren't implied by later ones.
Unlike `variable`, the `variable?` command does not support changing variable binder types.

The `variable?` command will give a suggestion to replace itself with a command of the form
`variable? ...binders... => ...binders...`.  The binders after the `=>` are the completed
list of binders. When this `=>` clause is present, the command verifies that the expanded
binders match the post-`=>` binders.  The purpose of this is to help keep code that uses
`variable?` resilient against changes to the typeclass hierarchy, at least in the sense
that this additional information can be used to debug issues that might arise.
One can also replace `variable? ...binders... =>` with `variable`.

The core algorithm is to try elaborating binders one at a time, and whenever there is a
typeclass instance inference failure, it synthesizes binder syntax for it and adds it to
the list of binders and tries again, recursively. There are no guarantees that this
process gives the "correct" list of binders.

Structures tagged with the `variable_alias` attribute can serve as aliases for a collection
of typeclasses. For example, given
```lean
@[variable_alias]
structure VectorSpace (k V : Type*) [Field k] [AddCommGroup V] [Module k V]
```
then `variable? [VectorSpace k V]` is
equivalent to `variable {k V : Type*} [Field k] [AddCommGroup V] [Module k V]`, assuming
that there are no pre-existing instances on `k` and `V`.
Note that this is not a simple replacement: it only adds instances not inferrable
from others in the current scope.

A word of warning: the core algorithm depends on pretty printing, so if terms that appear
in binders do not round trip, this algorithm can fail. That said, it has some support
for quantified binders such as `[∀ i, F i]`.

#guard_msgs
guardMsgsCmd
Init.Notation
`/-- ... -/ #guard_msgs in cmd` captures the messages generated by the command `cmd`
and checks that they match the contents of the docstring.

Basic example:
```lean
/--
error: unknown identifier 'x'
-/
#guard_msgs in
example : α := x
```
This checks that there is such an error and then consumes the message.

By default, the command captures all messages, but the filter condition can be adjusted.
For example, we can select only warnings:
```lean
/--
warning: declaration uses 'sorry'
-/
#guard_msgs(warning) in
example : α := sorry
```
or only errors
```lean
#guard_msgs(error) in
example : α := sorry
```
In the previous example, since warnings are not captured there is a warning on `sorry`.
We can drop the warning completely with
```lean
#guard_msgs(error, drop warning) in
example : α := sorry
```

In general, `#guard_msgs` accepts a comma-separated list of configuration clauses in parentheses:
```
#guard_msgs (configElt,*) in cmd
```
By default, the configuration list is `(all, whitespace := normalized, ordering := exact)`.

Message filters (processed in left-to-right order):
- `info`, `warning`, `error`: capture messages with the given severity level.
- `all`: capture all messages (the default).
- `drop info`, `drop warning`, `drop error`: drop messages with the given severity level.
- `drop all`: drop every message.

Whitespace handling (after trimming leading and trailing whitespace):
- `whitespace := exact` requires an exact whitespace match.
- `whitespace := normalized` converts all newline characters to a space before matching
  (the default). This allows breaking long lines.
- `whitespace := lax` collapses whitespace to a single space before matching.

Message ordering:
- `ordering := exact` uses the exact ordering of the messages (the default).
- `ordering := sorted` sorts the messages in lexicographic order.
  This helps with testing commands that are non-deterministic in their ordering.

For example, `#guard_msgs (error, drop all) in cmd` means to check warnings and drop
everything else.

mentioned names are in scope, and that the theorem statement is a valid proposition), but they are
discarded afterwards. This means that they cannot be used as axioms.

open
Parser.Command.open
Lean.Parser.Command
Makes names from other namespaces visible without writing the namespace prefix.

Names that are made available with `open` are visible within the current `section` or `namespace`
block. This makes referring to (type) definitions and theorems easier, but note that it can also
make [scoped instances], notations, and attributes from a different namespace available.

The `open` command can be used in a few different ways:

* `open Some.Namespace.Path1 Some.Namespace.Path2` makes all non-protected names in
  `Some.Namespace.Path1` and `Some.Namespace.Path2` available without the prefix, so that
  `Some.Namespace.Path1.x` and `Some.Namespace.Path2.y` can be referred to by writing only `x` and
  `y`.

* `open Some.Namespace.Path hiding def1 def2` opens all non-protected names in `Some.Namespace.Path`
  except `def1` and `def2`.

* `open Some.Namespace.Path (def1 def2)` only makes `Some.Namespace.Path.def1` and
  `Some.Namespace.Path.def2` available without the full prefix, so `Some.Namespace.Path.def3` would
  be unaffected.

  This works even if `def1` and `def2` are `protected`.

* `open Some.Namespace.Path renaming def1 → def1', def2 → def2'` same as `open Some.Namespace.Path
  (def1 def2)` but `def1`/`def2`'s names are changed to `def1'`/`def2'`.

  This works even if `def1` and `def2` are `protected`.

* `open scoped Some.Namespace.Path1 Some.Namespace.Path2` **only** opens [scoped instances],
  notations, and attributes from `Namespace1` and `Namespace2`; it does **not** make any other name
  available.

* `open <any of the open shapes above> in` makes the names `open`-ed visible only in the next
  command or expression.

`namespace <id>` opens a section with label `<id>` that influences naming and name resolution inside

* All names starting with `<id>.` become available in the namespace without the prefix. These names
  are preferred over names introduced by outer namespaces or `open`.
* Within a namespace, declarations can be `protected`, which excludes them from the effects of
  opening the namespace.

As with `section`, namespaces can be nested and the scope of a namespace is terminated by a

Also, one can leave out the body.

The command verifies that the new definition type-checks and that the type and value
provided are definitionally equal to the original declaration. However, this does not

#guard
Parser.Command.guardCmd
Init.Guard
Command to check that an expression evaluates to `true`.

`#guard e` elaborates `e` ensuring its type is `Bool` then evaluates `e` and checks that
the result is `true`. The term is elaborated *without* variables declared using `variable`, since
these cannot be evaluated.

Since this makes use of coercions, so long as a proposition `p` is decidable, one can write
`#guard p` rather than `#guard decide p`. A consequence to this is that if there is decidable
equality one can write `#guard a = b`. Note that this is not exactly the same as checking
if `a` and `b` evaluate to the same thing since it uses the `DecidableEq` instance to do
the evaluation.

Note: this uses the untrusted evaluator, so `#guard` passing is *not* a proof that the
expression equals `true`.
----help----
simproc
Parser.«command__Simproc__[_]_(_):=_»
Init.Simproc
A user-defined simplification procedure used by the `simp` tactic, and its variants.

open Lean Meta Simp
simproc ↓ shortCircuitAnd (And _ _) := fun e => do
  let_expr And p q := e | return .continue
  let r ← simp p
  let_expr False := r.expr | return .continue
  let proof ← mkAppM ``and_false_eq #[q, (← r.getProof)]
  return .done { expr := r.expr, proof? := some proof }
```
The `simp` tactic invokes `shortCircuitAnd` whenever it finds a term of the form `And _ _`.
The simplification procedures are stored in an (imperfect) discrimination tree.
The procedure should **not** assume the term `e` perfectly matches the given pattern.
The body of a simplification procedure must have type `Simproc`, which is an alias for
`Expr → SimpM Step`
You can instruct the simplifier to apply the procedure before its sub-expressions
have been simplified by using the modifier `↓` before the procedure name.
Simplification procedures can be also scoped or local.

universe
Parser.Command.universe
Lean.Parser.Command
Declares one or more universe variables.

`universe u v`

`Prop`, `Type`, `Type u` and `Sort u` are types that classify other types, also known as
*universes*. In `Type u` and `Sort u`, the variable `u` stands for the universe's *level*, and a
universe at level `u` can only classify universes that are at levels lower than `u`. For more
details on type universes, please refer to [the relevant chapter of Theorem Proving in Lean][tpil
universes].

Just as type arguments allow polymorphic definitions to be used at many different types, universe
parameters, represented by universe variables, allow a definition to be used at any required level.
While Lean mostly handles universe levels automatically, declaring them explicitly can provide more
control when writing signatures. The `universe` keyword allows the declared universe variables to be
used in a collection of definitions, and Lean will ensure that these definitions use them
consistently.

def id₃ (α : Type u) (a : α) := a
```

On a more technical note, using a universe variable only in the right-hand side of a definition
causes an error if the universe has not been declared previously.

```lean
def L₁.{u} := List (Type u)

-- def L₂ := List (Type u) -- error: `unknown universe level 'u'`

universe u
def L₃ := List (Type u)
```

## Examples

```lean
universe u v w

structure Pair (α : Type u) (β : Type v) : Type (max u v) where
  a : α
  b : β

#check Pair.{v, w}
-- Pair : Type v → Type w → Type (max v w)

variable
Parser.Command.variable
Lean.Parser.Command
Declares one or more typed variables, or modifies whether already-declared variables are
implicit.

Introduces variables that can be used in definitions within the same `namespace` or `section` block.
When a definition mentions a variable, Lean will add it as an argument of the definition. The
`variable` command is also able to add typeclass parameters. This is useful in particular when
writing many definitions that have parameters in common (see below for an example).

Variable declarations have the same flexibility as regular function paramaters. In particular they
can be [explicit, implicit][binder docs], or [instance implicit][tpil classes] (in which case they
can be anonymous). This can be changed, for instance one can turn explicit variable `x` into an
implicit one with `variable {x}`. Note that currently, you should avoid changing how variables are
bound and declare new variables at the same time; see [issue 2789] for more on this topic.

See [*Variables and Sections* from Theorem Proving in Lean][tpil vars] for a more detailed
discussion.

## Examples

```lean
section
  variable
    {α : Type u}      -- implicit
    (a : α)           -- explicit
    [instBEq : BEq α] -- instance implicit, named
    [Hashable α]      -- instance implicit, anonymous

  def isEqual (b : α) : Bool :=
    a == b

  #check isEqual
  -- isEqual.{u} {α : Type u} (a : α) [instBEq : BEq α] (b : α) : Bool

  variable
    {a} -- `a` is implicit now

  def eqComm {b : α} := a == b ↔ b == a

  #check eqComm
  -- eqComm.{u} {α : Type u} {a : α} [instBEq : BEq α] {b : α} : Prop
end
```

The following shows a typical use of `variable` to factor out definition arguments:

```lean
variable (Src : Type)

structure Logger where
  trace : List (Src × String)
#check Logger
-- Logger (Src : Type) : Type

namespace Logger
  -- switch `Src : Type` to be implicit until the `end Logger`
  variable {Src}

  def empty : Logger Src where
    trace := []
  #check empty
  -- Logger.empty {Src : Type} : Logger Src

  variable (log : Logger Src)

  def len :=
    log.trace.length
  #check len
  -- Logger.len {Src : Type} (log : Logger Src) : Nat

  variable (src : Src) [BEq Src]

  -- at this point all of `log`, `src`, `Src` and the `BEq` instance can all become arguments

  def filterSrc :=
    log.trace.filterMap
      fun (src', str') => if src' == src then some str' else none
  #check filterSrc
  -- Logger.filterSrc {Src : Type} (log : Logger Src) (src : Src) [inst✝ : BEq Src] : List String

  def lenSrc :=
    log.filterSrc src |>.length
  #check lenSrc
  -- Logger.lenSrc {Src : Type} (log : Logger Src) (src : Src) [inst✝ : BEq Src] : Nat
end Logger

initialize_simps_projections
Parser.Command.initialize_simps_projections
Mathlib.Tactic.Simps.Basic
This command specifies custom names and custom projections for the simp attribute `simpsAttr`.
* You can specify custom names by writing e.g.
  `initialize_simps_projections Equiv (toFun → apply, invFun → symm_apply)`.
* See Note [custom simps projection] and the examples below for information how to declare custom
  projections.
* For algebraic structures, we will automatically use the notation (like `Mul`)
  for the projections if such an instance is available.
* By default, the projections to parent structures are not default projections,
  but all the data-carrying fields are (including those in parent structures).
* You can disable a projection by default by running
  `initialize_simps_projections Equiv (-invFun)`
  This will ensure that no simp lemmas are generated for this projection,
  unless this projection is explicitly specified by the user.
* Conversely, you can enable a projection by default by running
  `initialize_simps_projections Equiv (+toEquiv)`.
* If you want the projection name added as a prefix in the generated lemma name, you can use
  `as_prefix fieldName`:
  `initialize_simps_projections Equiv (toFun → coe, as_prefix coe)`
  Note that this does not influence the parsing of projection names: if you have a declaration
  `foo` and you want to apply the projections `snd`, `coe` (which is a prefix) and `fst`, in that
  order you can run `@[simps snd_coe_fst] def foo ...` and this will generate a lemma with the
  name `coe_foo_snd_fst`.
  * Run `initialize_simps_projections?` (or `set_option trace.simps.verbose true`)
  to see the generated projections.
* Running `initialize_simps_projections MyStruc` without arguments is not necessary, it has the
  same effect if you just add `@[simps]` to a declaration.
* It is recommended to call `@[simps]` or `initialize_simps_projections` in the same file as the
  structure declaration. Otherwise, the projections could be generated multiple times in different
  files.

Some common uses:
* If you define a new homomorphism-like structure (like `MulHom`) you can just run
  `initialize_simps_projections` after defining the `DFunLike` instance (or instance that implies
  a `DFunLike` instance).
  ```
    instance {mM : Mul M} {mN : Mul N} : DFunLike (MulHom M N) M N := ...
    initialize_simps_projections MulHom (toFun → apply)
  ```
  This will generate `foo_apply` lemmas for each declaration `foo`.
* If you prefer `coe_foo` lemmas that state equalities between functions, use
  `initialize_simps_projections MulHom (toFun → coe, as_prefix coe)`
  In this case you have to use `@[simps (config := .asFn)]` or equivalently
  `@[simps (config := .asFn)]` whenever you call `@[simps]`.
* You can also initialize to use both, in which case you have to choose which one to use by default,
  by using either of the following
  ```
    initialize_simps_projections MulHom (toFun → apply, toFun → coe, as_prefix coe, -coe)
    initialize_simps_projections MulHom (toFun → apply, toFun → coe, as_prefix coe, -apply)
  ```
  In the first case, you can get both lemmas using `@[simps, simps (config := .asFn) coe]` and in
  the second case you can get both lemmas using `@[simps (config := .asFn), simps apply]`.
* If you declare a new homomorphism-like structure (like `RelEmbedding`),
  then `initialize_simps_projections` will automatically find any `DFunLike` coercions
  that will be used as the default projection for the `toFun` field.
  ```
    initialize_simps_projections relEmbedding (toFun → apply)
  ```
* If you have an isomorphism-like structure (like `Equiv`) you often want to define a custom
  projection for the inverse:
  ```
    def Equiv.Simps.symm_apply (e : α ≃ β) : β → α := e.symm
    initialize_simps_projections Equiv (toFun → apply, invFun → symm_apply)
  ```

Mathlib.Tactic.DeprecateMe
Writing
```lean
deprecate to new_name new_name₂ ... new_nameₙ
theorem old_name : True := .intro
```
where `new_name new_name₂ ... new_nameₙ` is a sequence of identifiers produces the
`Try this` suggestion:
```lean
theorem new_name : True := .intro

@[deprecated (since := "YYYY-MM-DD")] alias old_name := new_name

@[deprecated (since := "YYYY-MM-DD")] alias old_name₂ := new_name₂
...

@[deprecated (since := "YYYY-MM-DD")] alias old_nameₙ := new_nameₙ
```
where `old_name old_name₂ ... old_nameₙ` are the non-blacklisted declarations
(auto)generated by the initial command.

The "YYYY-MM-DD" entry is today's date and it is automatically filled in.

`deprecate to` makes an effort to match `old_name`, the "visible" name, with
`new_name`, the first identifier produced by the user.
The "old", autogenerated declarations `old_name₂ ... old_nameₙ` are retrieved in alphabetical order.
In the case in which the initial declaration produces at most 1 non-blacklisted
declarations besides itself, the alphabetical sorting is irrelevant.

Technically, the command also take an optional `String` argument to fill in the date in `since`.
However, its use is mostly intended for debugging purposes, where having a variable date would
make tests time-dependent.

assert_not_exists
commandAssert_not_exists_
Mathlib.Util.AssertExists
`assert_not_exists n` is a user command that asserts that a declaration named `n` *does not exist*
in the current import scope.

Be careful to use names (e.g. `Rat`) rather than notations (e.g. `ℚ`).

It may be used (sparingly!) in mathlib to enforce plans that certain files
are independent of each other.

If you encounter an error on an `assert_not_exists` command while developing mathlib,
it is probably because you have introduced new import dependencies to a file.

In this case, you should refactor your work
(for example by creating new files rather than adding imports to existing files).
You should *not* delete the `assert_not_exists` statement without careful discussion ahead of time.

lrat_proof
Sat.commandLrat_proof_Example____
Mathlib.Tactic.Sat.FromLRAT
A macro for producing SAT proofs from CNF / LRAT files.
These files are commonly used in the SAT community for writing proofs.

The input to the `lrat_proof` command is the name of the theorem to define,
and the statement (written in CNF format) and the proof (in LRAT format).
For example:
```
lrat_proof foo
  "p cnf 2 4  1 2 0  -1 2 0  1 -2 0  -1 -2 0"
  "5 -2 0 4 3 0  5 d 3 4 0  6 1 0 5 1 0  6 d 1 0  7 0 5 2 6 0"
```
produces a theorem:
```
foo : ∀ (a a_1 : Prop), (¬a ∧ ¬a_1 ∨ a ∧ ¬a_1) ∨ ¬a ∧ a_1 ∨ a ∧ a_1
```

* You can see the theorem statement by hovering over the word `foo`.
* You can use the `example` keyword in place of `foo` to avoid generating a theorem.
* You can use the `include_str` macro in place of the two strings
  to load CNF / LRAT files from disk.
