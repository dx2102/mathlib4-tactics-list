have
Parser.Tactic.tacticHave_
Init.Tactics
The `have` tactic is for adding hypotheses to the local context of the main goal.
* `have h : t := e` adds the hypothesis `h : t` if `e` is a term of type `t`.
* `have h := e` uses the type of `e` for `t`.
* `have : t := e` and `have := e` use `this` for the name of the hypothesis.
* `have pat := e` for a pattern `pat` is equivalent to `match e with | pat => _`,
  where `_` stands for the tactics that follow this one.
  It is convenient for types that have only one applicable constructor.
  For example, given `h : p ∧ q ∧ r`, `have ⟨h₁, h₂, h₃⟩ := h` produces the
  hypotheses `h₁ : p`, `h₂ : q`, and `h₃ : r`.

*  `natDegree f ≤ d`,
*  `degree f ≤ d`,
*  `coeff f d = r`, if `d` is the degree of `f`.

The tactic may leave goals of the form `d' = d` `d' ≤ d`, or `r ≠ 0`, where `d'` in `ℕ` or
`WithBot ℕ` is the tactic's guess of the degree, and `r` is the coefficient's guess of the
leading coefficient of `f`.

`compute_degree` applies `norm_num` to the left-hand side of all side goals, trying to clos them.

simp_rw
tacticSimp_rw___
Mathlib.Tactic.SimpRw
`simp_rw` functions as a mix of `simp` and `rw`. Like `rw`, it applies each
rewrite rule in the given order, but like `simp` it repeatedly applies these
rules and also under binders like `∀ x, ...`, `∃ x, ...` and `fun x ↦...`.
Usage:

- `simp_rw [lemma_1, ..., lemma_n]` will rewrite the goal by applying the
  lemmas in that order. A lemma preceded by `←` is applied in the reverse direction.
- `simp_rw [lemma_1, ..., lemma_n] at h₁ ... hₙ` will rewrite the given hypotheses.
- `simp_rw [...] at *` rewrites in the whole context: all hypotheses and the goal.

Lemmas passed to `simp_rw` must be expressions that are valid arguments to `simp`.
For example, neither `simp` nor `rw` can solve the following, but `simp_rw` can:

```lean
example {a : ℕ}
    (h1 : ∀ a b : ℕ, a - 1 ≤ b ↔ a ≤ b + 1)

use!
«tacticUse!___,,»
Mathlib.Tactic.Use
`use e₁, e₂, ⋯` is similar to `exists`, but unlike `exists` it is equivalent to applying the tactic
`refine ⟨e₁, e₂, ⋯, ?_, ⋯, ?_⟩` with any number of placeholders (rather than just one) and
then trying to close goals associated to the placeholders with a configurable discharger (rather
than just `try trivial`).

Examples:

```lean
example : ∃ x : Nat, x = x := by use 42

example : ∃ x : Nat, ∃ y : Nat, x = y := by use 42, 42

example : ∃ x : String × String, x.1 = x.2 := by use ("forty-two", "forty-two")
```

`use! e₁, e₂, ⋯` is similar but it applies constructors everywhere rather than just for
goals that correspond to the last argument of a constructor. This gives the effect that
nested constructors are being flattened out, with the supplied values being used along the
leaves and nodes of the tree of constructors.
With `use!` one can feed in each `42` one at a time:

```lean
example : ∃ p : Nat × Nat, p.1 = p.2 := by use! 42, 42

example : ∃ p : Nat × Nat, p.1 = p.2 := by use! (42, 42)
```

The second line makes use of the fact that `use!` tries refining with the argument before
applying a constructor. Also note that `use`/`use!` by default uses a tactic
called `use_discharger` to discharge goals, so `use! 42` will close the goal in this example since
`use_discharger` applies `rfl`, which as a consequence solves for the other `Nat` metavariable.

These tactics take an optional discharger to handle remaining explicit `Prop` constructor arguments.
By default it is `use (discharger := try with_reducible use_discharger) e₁, e₂, ⋯`.
To turn off the discharger and keep all goals, use `(discharger := skip)`.
To allow "heavy refls", use `(discharger := try use_discharger)`.

linarith!
tacticLinarith!_
Mathlib.Tactic.Linarith.Frontend
`linarith` attempts to find a contradiction between hypotheses that are linear (in)equalities.
Equivalently, it can prove a linear inequality by assuming its negation and proving `False`.

In theory, `linarith` should prove any goal that is true in the theory of linear arithmetic over
the rationals. While there is some special handling for non-dense orders like `Nat` and `Int`,
this tactic is not complete for these theories and will not prove every true goal. It will solve
goals over arbitrary types that instantiate `LinearOrderedCommRing`.

An example:
```lean
example (x y z : ℚ) (h1 : 2*x < 3*y) (h2 : -4*x + 2*z < 0)
        (h3 : 12*y - 4* z < 0)  : False := by
  linarith
```

`linarith` will use all appropriate hypotheses and the negation of the goal, if applicable.
Disequality hypotheses require case splitting and are not normally considered
(see the `splitNe` option below).

`linarith [t1, t2, t3]` will additionally use proof terms `t1, t2, t3`.

`linarith only [h1, h2, h3, t1, t2, t3]` will use only the goal (if relevant), local hypotheses
`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, and proofs `t1`, `t2`, `t3`. It will ignore the rest of the local context.

`linarith!` will use a stronger reducibility setting to try to identify atoms. For example,
```lean
example (x : ℚ) : id x ≥ x := by
  linarith
```
will fail, because `linarith` will not identify `x` and `id x`. `linarith!` will.
This can sometimes be expensive.

`linarith (config := { .. })` takes a config object with five
optional arguments:
* `discharger` specifies a tactic to be used for reducing an algebraic equation in the
  proof stage. The default is `ring`. Other options include `simp` for basic
  problems.
* `transparency` controls how hard `linarith` will try to match atoms to each other. By default
  it will only unfold `reducible` definitions.
* If `splitHypotheses` is true, `linarith` will split conjunctions in the context into separate
  hypotheses.
* If `splitNe` is `true`, `linarith` will case split on disequality hypotheses.
  For a given `x ≠ y` hypothesis, `linarith` is run with both `x < y` and `x > y`,
  and so this runs linarith exponentially many times with respect to the number of
  disequality hypotheses. (`false` by default.)
* If `exfalso` is `false`, `linarith` will fail when the goal is neither an inequality nor `False`.
  (`true` by default.)
* `restrict_type` (not yet implemented in mathlib4)
  will only use hypotheses that are inequalities over `tp`. This is useful
  if you have e.g. both integer and rational valued inequalities in the local context, which can
  sometimes confuse the tactic.

A variant, `nlinarith`, does some basic preprocessing to handle some nonlinear goals.

The option `set_option trace.linarith true` will trace certain intermediate stages of the `linarith`
routine.

tfae_have
TFAE.tfaeHave
Mathlib.Tactic.TFAE
`tfae_have` introduces hypotheses for proving goals of the form `TFAE [P₁, P₂, ...]`. Specifically,
`tfae_have i arrow j` introduces a hypothesis of type `Pᵢ arrow Pⱼ` to the local context,
where `arrow` can be `→`, `←`, or `↔`. Note that `i` and `j` are natural number indices (beginning
at 1) used to specify the propositions `P₁, P₂, ...` that appear in the `TFAE` goal list. A proof
is required afterward, typically via a tactic block.

```lean
example (h : P → R) : TFAE [P, Q, R] := by
  tfae_have 1 → 3
  · exact h
  ...
```
The resulting context now includes `tfae_1_to_3 : P → R`.

The introduced hypothesis can be given a custom name, in analogy to `have` syntax:
```lean
tfae_have h : 2 ↔ 3
```

Once sufficient hypotheses have been introduced by `tfae_have`, `tfae_finish` can be used to close
the goal.

nontriviality
Nontriviality.nontriviality
Mathlib.Tactic.Nontriviality.Core
Attempts to generate a `Nontrivial α` hypothesis.

The tactic first checks to see that there is not already a `Nontrivial α` instance
before trying to synthesize one using other techniques.

If the goal is an (in)equality, the type `α` is inferred from the goal.
Otherwise, the type needs to be specified in the tactic invocation, as `nontriviality α`.

The `nontriviality` tactic will first look for strict inequalities amongst the hypotheses,
and use these to derive the `Nontrivial` instance directly.

Otherwise, it will perform a case split on `Subsingleton α ∨ Nontrivial α`, and attempt to discharge
the `Subsingleton` goal using `simp [h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ, nontriviality]`, where `[h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ]` is
a list of additional `simp` lemmas that can be passed to `nontriviality` using the syntax
`nontriviality α using h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ`.

It then moves `a` to the far right and `b` to the far left of each addition in which they appear.
The side to which the summands are moved is determined by the presence or absence of the arrow `←`.

The inputs `a, b,...` can be any terms, also with underscores.
The tactic uses the first "new" summand that unifies with each one of the given inputs.

There is a multiplicative variant, called `move_mul`.

There is also a general tactic for a "binary associative commutative operation": `move_oper`.
In this case the syntax requires providing first a term whose head symbol is the operation.

* `guard_hyp h : t` checks the type up to reducible defeq,
* `guard_hyp h :~ t` checks the type up to default defeq,
* `guard_hyp h :ₛ t` checks the type up to syntactic equality,
* `guard_hyp h :ₐ t` checks the type up to alpha equality.
* `guard_hyp h := v` checks value up to reducible defeq,
* `guard_hyp h :=~ v` checks value up to default defeq,
* `guard_hyp h :=ₛ v` checks value up to syntactic equality,
* `guard_hyp h :=ₐ v` checks the value up to alpha equality.

The value `v` is elaborated using the type of `h` as the expected type.

Mathlib.Tactic.SimpIntro
The `simp_intro` tactic is a combination of `simp` and `intro`: it will simplify the types of
variables as it introduces them and uses the new variables to simplify later arguments
and the goal.
* `simp_intro x y z` introduces variables named `x y z`
* `simp_intro x y z ..` introduces variables named `x y z` and then keeps introducing `_` binders
* `simp_intro (config := cfg) (discharger := tac) x y .. only [h₁, h₂]`:

reduce_mod_char
ReduceModChar.reduce_mod_char
Mathlib.Tactic.ReduceModChar
The tactic `reduce_mod_char` looks for numeric expressions in characteristic `p`
and reduces these to lie between `0` and `p`.

For example:
```
example : (5 : ZMod 4) = 1 := by reduce_mod_char
example : (X ^ 2 - 3 * X + 4 : (ZMod 4)[X]) = X ^ 2 + X := by reduce_mod_char
```

It also handles negation, turning it into multiplication by `p - 1`,
and similarly subtraction.

This tactic uses the type of the subexpression to figure out if it is indeed of positive
characteristic, for improved performance compared to trying to synthesise a `CharP` instance.
The variant `reduce_mod_char!` also tries to use `CharP R n` hypotheses in the context.
(Limitations of the typeclass system mean the tactic can't search for a `CharP R n` instance if
`n` is not yet known; use `have : CharP R n := inferInstance; reduce_mod_char!` as a workaround.)

Mathlib.Tactic.MoveAdd
The tactic `move_add` rearranges summands of expressions.
Calling `move_add [a, ← b, ...]` matches `a, b,...` with summands in the main goal.
It then moves `a` to the far right and `b` to the far left of each addition in which they appear.
The side to which the summands are moved is determined by the presence or absence of the arrow `←`.

The inputs `a, b,...` can be any terms, also with underscores.
The tactic uses the first "new" summand that unifies with each one of the given inputs.

There is a multiplicative variant, called `move_mul`.

There is also a general tactic for a "binary associative commutative operation": `move_oper`.
In this case the syntax requires providing first a term whose head symbol is the operation.
E.g. `move_oper HAdd.hAdd [...]` is the same as `move_add`, while `move_oper Max.max [...]`
rearranges `max`s.

* For every pair of hypotheses `a1 R1 b1`, `a2 R2 b2` in the context, `R1, R2 ∈ {<, ≤, =}`,

cases
Parser.Tactic.cases
Init.Tactics
Assuming `x` is a variable in the local context with an inductive type,
`cases x` splits the main goal, producing one goal for each constructor of the
inductive type, in which the target is replaced by a general instance of that constructor.
If the type of an element in the local context depends on `x`,
that element is reverted and reintroduced afterward,
so that the case split affects that hypothesis as well.
`cases` detects unreachable cases and closes them automatically.

For example, given `n : Nat` and a goal with a hypothesis `h : P n` and target `Q n`,
`cases n` produces one goal with hypothesis `h : P 0` and target `Q 0`,
and one goal with hypothesis `h : P (Nat.succ a)` and target `Q (Nat.succ a)`.
Here the name `a` is chosen automatically and is not accessible.
You can use `with` to provide the variables names for each constructor.
- `cases e`, where `e` is an expression instead of a variable, generalizes `e` in the goal,
  and then cases on the resulting variable.
- Given `as : List α`, `cases as with | nil => tac₁ | cons a as' => tac₂`,
  uses tactic `tac₁` for the `nil` case, and `tac₂` for the `cons` case,
  and `a` and `as'` are used as names for the new variables introduced.
- `cases h : e`, where `e` is a variable or an expression,
  performs cases on `e` as above, but also adds a hypothesis `h : e = ...` to each hypothesis,
  where `...` is the constructor instance for that particular case.

Mathlib.Tactic.ByContra
If the target of the main goal is a proposition `p`,

`by_contra! h` can be used to name the hypothesis `h : ¬ p`.
The hypothesis `¬ p` will be negation normalized using `push_neg`.
For instance, `¬ a < b` will be changed to `b ≤ a`.
`by_contra! h : q` will normalize negations in `¬ p`, normalize negations in `q`,
and then check that the two normalized forms are equal.
The resulting hypothesis is the pre-normalized form, `q`.
If the name `h` is not explicitly provided, then `this` will be used as name.
This tactic uses classical reasoning.
It is a variant on the tactic `by_contra`.

linear_combination2
LinearCombination.tacticLinear_combination2____
Mathlib.Tactic.LinearCombination
`linear_combination` attempts to simplify the target by creating a linear combination
  of a list of equalities and subtracting it from the target.
  The tactic will create a linear
  combination by adding the equalities together from left to right, so the order
  of the input hypotheses does matter.  If the `normalize` field of the
  configuration is set to false, then the tactic will simply set the user up to
  prove their target using the linear combination instead of normalizing the subtraction.

Note: The left and right sides of all the equalities should have the same
  type, and the coefficients should also have this type.  There must be
  instances of `Mul` and `AddGroup` for this type.

* The input `e` in `linear_combination e` is a linear combination of proofs of equalities,
  given as a sum/difference of coefficients multiplied by expressions.
  The coefficients may be arbitrary expressions.
  The expressions can be arbitrary proof terms proving equalities.
  Most commonly they are hypothesis names `h1, h2, ...`.
* `linear_combination (norm := tac) e` runs the "normalization tactic" `tac`
  on the subgoal(s) after constructing the linear combination.
  * The default normalization tactic is `ring1`, which closes the goal or fails.
  * To get a subgoal in the case that it is not immediately provable, use
    `ring_nf` as the normalization tactic.
  * To avoid normalization entirely, use `skip` as the normalization tactic.
* `linear_combination (exp := n) e` will take the goal to the `n`th power before subtracting the
  combination `e`. In other words, if the goal is `t1 = t2`, `linear_combination (exp := n) e`
  will change the goal to `(t1 - t2)^n = 0` before proceeding as above.
  This feature is not supported for `linear_combination2`.
* `linear_combination2 e` is the same as `linear_combination e` but it produces two
  subgoals instead of one: rather than proving that `(a - b) - (a' - b') = 0` where
  `a' = b'` is the linear combination from `e` and `a = b` is the goal,
  it instead attempts to prove `a = a'` and `b = b'`.
  Because it does not use subtraction, this form is applicable also to semirings.
  * Note that a goal which is provable by `linear_combination e` may not be provable
    by `linear_combination2 e`; in general you may need to add a coefficient to `e`
    to make both sides match, as in `linear_combination2 e + c`.
  * You can also reverse equalities using `← h`, so for example if `h₁ : a = b`
    then `2 * (← h)` is a proof of `2 * b = 2 * a`.

Example Usage:
```

rewrite
Parser.Tactic.rewriteSeq
Init.Tactics
`rewrite [e]` applies identity `e` as a rewrite rule to the target of the main goal.
If `e` is preceded by left arrow (`←` or `<-`), the rewrite is applied in the reverse direction.
If `e` is a defined constant, then the equational theorems associated with `e` are used.
This provides a convenient way to unfold `e`.
- `rewrite [e₁, ..., eₙ]` applies the given rules sequentially.
- `rewrite [e] at l` rewrites `e` at location(s) `l`, where `l` is either `*` or a
  list of hypotheses in the local context. In the latter case, a turnstile `⊢` or `|-`
  can also be used, to signify the target of the goal.

Using `rw (config := {occs := .pos L}) [e]`,
where `L : List Nat`, you can control which "occurrences" are rewritten.
(This option applies to each rule, so usually this will only be used with a single rule.)
Occurrences count from `1`.
At each allowed occurrence, arguments of the rewrite rule `e` may be instantiated,
restricting which later rewrites can be found.
(Disallowed occurrences do not result in instantiation.)

Parser.Tactic.applyAssumption
Init.Tactics
`apply_assumption` looks for an assumption of the form `... → ∀ _, ... → head`
where `head` matches the current goal.

You can specify additional rules to apply using `apply_assumption [...]`.
By default `apply_assumption` will also try `rfl`, `trivial`, `congrFun`, and `congrArg`.
If you don't want these, or don't want to use all hypotheses, use `apply_assumption only [...]`.
You can use `apply_assumption [-h]` to omit a local hypothesis.
You can use `apply_assumption using [a₁, ...]` to use all lemmas which have been labelled
with the attributes `aᵢ` (these attributes must be created using `register_label_attr`).

`apply_assumption` will use consequences of local hypotheses obtained via `symm`.

If `apply_assumption` fails, it will call `exfalso` and try again.
Thus if there is an assumption of the form `P → ¬ Q`, the new tactic state
will have two goals, `P` and `Q`.

You can pass a further configuration via the syntax `apply_rules (config := {...}) lemmas`.
The options supported are the same as for `solve_by_elim` (and include all the options for `apply`).

polyrith
Polyrith.«tacticPolyrithOnly[_]»
Mathlib.Tactic.Polyrith
Attempts to prove polynomial equality goals through polynomial arithmetic
on the hypotheses (and additional proof terms if the user specifies them).
It proves the goal by generating an appropriate call to the tactic
`linear_combination`. If this call succeeds, the call to `linear_combination`
is suggested to the user.

* `polyrith` will use all relevant hypotheses in the local context.
* `polyrith [t1, t2, t3]` will add proof terms t1, t2, t3 to the local context.
* `polyrith only [h1, h2, h3, t1, t2, t3]` will use only local hypotheses
  `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, and proofs `t1`, `t2`, `t3`. It will ignore the rest of the local context.

Notes:
* This tactic only works with a working internet connection, since it calls Sage
  using the SageCell web API at <https://sagecell.sagemath.org/>.
  Many thanks to the Sage team and organization for allowing this use.
* This tactic assumes that the user has `python3` installed and available on the path.
  (Test by opening a terminal and executing `python3 --version`.)
  It also assumes that the `requests` library is installed: `python3 -m pip install requests`.

Examples:

```lean
example (x y : ℚ) (h1 : x*y + 2*x = 1) (h2 : x = y) :
    x*y = -2*y + 1 := by
  polyrith

induction
Parser.Tactic.induction
Init.Tactics
Assuming `x` is a variable in the local context with an inductive type,
`induction x` applies induction on `x` to the main goal,
producing one goal for each constructor of the inductive type,
in which the target is replaced by a general instance of that constructor
and an inductive hypothesis is added for each recursive argument to the constructor.
If the type of an element in the local context depends on `x`,
that element is reverted and reintroduced afterward,
so that the inductive hypothesis incorporates that hypothesis as well.

For example, given `n : Nat` and a goal with a hypothesis `h : P n` and target `Q n`,
`induction n` produces one goal with hypothesis `h : P 0` and target `Q 0`,
and one goal with hypotheses `h : P (Nat.succ a)` and `ih₁ : P a → Q a` and target `Q (Nat.succ a)`.
Here the names `a` and `ih₁` are chosen automatically and are not accessible.
You can use `with` to provide the variables names for each constructor.
- `induction e`, where `e` is an expression instead of a variable,
  generalizes `e` in the goal, and then performs induction on the resulting variable.
- `induction e using r` allows the user to specify the principle of induction that should be used.
  Here `r` should be a term whose result type must be of the form `C t`,
  where `C` is a bound variable and `t` is a (possibly empty) sequence of bound variables
- `induction e generalizing z₁ ... zₙ`, where `z₁ ... zₙ` are variables in the local context,
  generalizes over `z₁ ... zₙ` before applying the induction but then introduces them in each goal.
  In other words, the net effect is that each inductive hypothesis is generalized.
- Given `x : Nat`, `induction x with | zero => tac₁ | succ x' ih => tac₂`
  uses tactic `tac₁` for the `zero` case, and `tac₂` for the `succ` case.

wlog
wlog
Mathlib.Tactic.WLOG
`wlog h : P` will add an assumption `h : P` to the main goal, and add a side goal that requires
showing that the case `h : ¬ P` can be reduced to the case where `P` holds (typically by symmetry).

The side goal will be at the top of the stack. In this side goal, there will be two additional
assumptions:
- `h : ¬ P`: the assumption that `P` does not hold
- `this`: which is the statement that in the old context `P` suffices to prove the goal.
  By default, the name `this` is used, but the idiom `with H` can be added to specify the name:
  `wlog h : P with H`.

Typically, it is useful to use the variant `wlog h : P generalizing x y`,
to revert certain parts of the context before creating the new goal.
In this way, the wlog-claim `this` can be applied to `x` and `y` in different orders
(exploiting symmetry, which is the typical use case).

By default, the entire context is reverted.

For example, given `n : Nat`, and a target `if n = 0 then Q else R`, `split` will generate

`¬n = 0` and target `R`.  Note that the introduced hypothesis is unnamed, and is commonly

omega
Parser.Tactic.omega
Init.Tactics
The `omega` tactic, for resolving integer and natural linear arithmetic problems.

It is not yet a full decision procedure (no "dark" or "grey" shadows),
but should be effective on many problems.

We handle hypotheses of the form `x = y`, `x < y`, `x ≤ y`, and `k ∣ x` for `x y` in `Nat` or `Int`
(and `k` a literal), along with negations of these statements.

We decompose the sides of the inequalities as linear combinations of atoms.

If we encounter `x / k` or `x % k` for literal integers `k` we introduce new auxiliary variables
and the relevant inequalities.

On the first pass, we do not perform case splits on natural subtraction.
If `omega` fails, we recursively perform a case split on
a natural subtraction appearing in a hypothesis, and try again.

The options
```
omega (config :=
  { splitDisjunctions := true, splitNatSub := true, splitNatAbs := true, splitMinMax := true })
```
can be used to:
* `splitDisjunctions`: split any disjunctions found in the context,
  if the problem is not otherwise solvable.
* `splitNatSub`: for each appearance of `((a - b : Nat) : Int)`, split on `a ≤ b` if necessary.
* `splitNatAbs`: for each appearance of `Int.natAbs a`, split on `0 ≤ a` if necessary.
* `splitMinMax`: for each occurrence of `min a b`, split on `min a b = a ∨ min a b = b`
Currently, all of these are on by default.

rify
Rify.rify
Mathlib.Tactic.Rify
The `rify` tactic is used to shift propositions from `ℕ`, `ℤ` or `ℚ` to `ℝ`.
Although less useful than its cousins `zify` and `qify`, it can be useful when your
goal or context already involves real numbers.

In the example below, assumption `hn` is about natural numbers, `hk` is about integers
and involves casting a natural number to `ℤ`, and the conclusion is about real numbers.
The proof uses `rify` to lift both assumptions to `ℝ` before calling `linarith`.
```
example {n : ℕ} {k : ℤ} (hn : 8 ≤ n) (hk : 2 * k ≤ n + 2) :
    (0 : ℝ) < n - k - 1 := by
  rify at hn hk /- Now have hn : 8 ≤ (n : ℝ)   hk : 2 * (k : ℝ) ≤ (n : ℝ) + 2-/
  linarith
```

`rify` makes use of the `@[zify_simps]`, `@[qify_simps]` and `@[rify_simps]` attributes to move
propositions, and the `push_cast` tactic to simplify the `ℝ`-valued expressions.

`rify` can be given extra lemmas to use in simplification. This is especially useful in the
presence of nat subtraction: passing `≤` arguments will allow `push_cast` to do more work.
```
example (a b c : ℕ) (h : a - b < c) (hab : b ≤ a) : a < b + c := by
  rify [hab] at h ⊢
  linarith
```
Note that `zify` or `qify` would work just as well in the above example (and `zify` is the natural
choice since it is enough to get rid of the pathological `ℕ` subtraction).

gcongr
GCongr.tacticGcongr__With__
Mathlib.Tactic.GCongr.Core
The `gcongr` tactic applies "generalized congruence" rules, reducing a relational goal
between a LHS and RHS matching the same pattern to relational subgoals between the differing
inputs to the pattern.  For example,
```
example {a b x c d : ℝ} (h1 : a + 1 ≤ b + 1) (h2 : c + 2 ≤ d + 2) :
    x ^ 2 * a + c ≤ x ^ 2 * b + d := by
  gcongr
  · linarith
  · linarith
```
This example has the goal of proving the relation `≤` between a LHS and RHS both of the pattern
```
x ^ 2 * ?_ + ?_
```
(with inputs `a`, `c` on the left and `b`, `d` on the right); after the use of
`gcongr`, we have the simpler goals `a ≤ b` and `c ≤ d`.

A pattern can be provided explicitly; this is useful if a non-maximal match is desired:
```
example {a b c d x : ℝ} (h : a + c + 1 ≤ b + d + 1) :
    x ^ 2 * (a + c) + 5 ≤ x ^ 2 * (b + d) + 5 := by
  gcongr x ^ 2 * ?_ + 5
  linarith
```

The "generalized congruence" rules used are the library lemmas which have been tagged with the
attribute `@[gcongr]`.  For example, the first example constructs the proof term
```
add_le_add (mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left _ (pow_bit0_nonneg x 1)) _
```
using the generalized congruence lemmas `add_le_add` and `mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left`.

The tactic attempts to discharge side goals to these "generalized congruence" lemmas (such as the
side goal `0 ≤ x ^ 2` in the above application of `mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left`) using the tactic
`gcongr_discharger`, which wraps `positivity` but can also be extended. Side goals not discharged
in this way are left for the user.

lift
lift
Mathlib.Tactic.Lift
Lift an expression to another type.
* Usage: `'lift' expr 'to' expr ('using' expr)? ('with' id (id id?)?)?`.
* If `n : ℤ` and `hn : n ≥ 0` then the tactic `lift n to ℕ using hn` creates a new
  constant of type `ℕ`, also named `n` and replaces all occurrences of the old variable `(n : ℤ)`
  with `↑n` (where `n` in the new variable). It will remove `n` and `hn` from the context.
  + So for example the tactic `lift n to ℕ using hn` transforms the goal
    `n : ℤ, hn : n ≥ 0, h : P n ⊢ n = 3` to `n : ℕ, h : P ↑n ⊢ ↑n = 3`
    (here `P` is some term of type `ℤ → Prop`).
* The argument `using hn` is optional, the tactic `lift n to ℕ` does the same, but also creates a
  new subgoal that `n ≥ 0` (where `n` is the old variable).
  This subgoal will be placed at the top of the goal list.
  + So for example the tactic `lift n to ℕ` transforms the goal
    `n : ℤ, h : P n ⊢ n = 3` to two goals
    `n : ℤ, h : P n ⊢ n ≥ 0` and `n : ℕ, h : P ↑n ⊢ ↑n = 3`.
* You can also use `lift n to ℕ using e` where `e` is any expression of type `n ≥ 0`.
* Use `lift n to ℕ with k` to specify the name of the new variable.
* Use `lift n to ℕ with k hk` to also specify the name of the equality `↑k = n`. In this case, `n`
  will remain in the context. You can use `rfl` for the name of `hk` to substitute `n` away
  (i.e. the default behavior).
* You can also use `lift e to ℕ with k hk` where `e` is any expression of type `ℤ`.
  In this case, the `hk` will always stay in the context, but it will be used to rewrite `e` in
  all hypotheses and the target.
  + So for example the tactic `lift n + 3 to ℕ using hn with k hk` transforms the goal
    `n : ℤ, hn : n + 3 ≥ 0, h : P (n + 3) ⊢ n + 3 = 2 * n` to the goal
    `n : ℤ, k : ℕ, hk : ↑k = n + 3, h : P ↑k ⊢ ↑k = 2 * n`.
* The tactic `lift n to ℕ using h` will remove `h` from the context. If you want to keep it,
  specify it again as the third argument to `with`, like this: `lift n to ℕ using h with n rfl h`.
* More generally, this can lift an expression from `α` to `β` assuming that there is an instance
  of `CanLift α β`. In this case the proof obligation is specified by `CanLift.prf`.
* Given an instance `CanLift β γ`, it can also lift `α → β` to `α → γ`; more generally, given
  `β : Π a : α, Type*`, `γ : Π a : α, Type*`, and `[Π a : α, CanLift (β a) (γ a)]`, it
  automatically generates an instance `CanLift (Π a, β a) (Π a, γ a)`.

`lift` is in some sense dual to the `zify` tactic. `lift (z : ℤ) to ℕ` will change the type of an
integer `z` (in the supertype) to `ℕ` (the subtype), given a proof that `z ≥ 0`;
propositions concerning `z` will still be over `ℤ`. `zify` changes propositions about `ℕ` (the
subtype) to propositions about `ℤ` (the supertype), without changing the type of any variable.

rcases
Parser.Tactic.rcases
Init.RCases
`rcases` is a tactic that will perform `cases` recursively, according to a pattern. It is used to
destructure hypotheses or expressions composed of inductive types like `h1 : a ∧ b ∧ c ∨ d` or
`h2 : ∃ x y, trans_rel R x y`. Usual usage might be `rcases h1 with ⟨ha, hb, hc⟩ | hd` or
`rcases h2 with ⟨x, y, _ | ⟨z, hxz, hzy⟩⟩` for these examples.

Each element of an `rcases` pattern is matched against a particular local hypothesis (most of which
are generated during the execution of `rcases` and represent individual elements destructured from
the input expression). An `rcases` pattern has the following grammar:

* A name like `x`, which names the active hypothesis as `x`.
* A blank `_`, which does nothing (letting the automatic naming system used by `cases` name the
  hypothesis).
* A hyphen `-`, which clears the active hypothesis and any dependents.
* The keyword `rfl`, which expects the hypothesis to be `h : a = b`, and calls `subst` on the
  hypothesis (which has the effect of replacing `b` with `a` everywhere or vice versa).
* A type ascription `p : ty`, which sets the type of the hypothesis to `ty` and then matches it
  against `p`. (Of course, `ty` must unify with the actual type of `h` for this to work.)
* A tuple pattern `⟨p1, p2, p3⟩`, which matches a constructor with many arguments, or a series
  of nested conjunctions or existentials. For example if the active hypothesis is `a ∧ b ∧ c`,
  then the conjunction will be destructured, and `p1` will be matched against `a`, `p2` against `b`
  and so on.
* A `@` before a tuple pattern as in `@⟨p1, p2, p3⟩` will bind all arguments in the constructor,
  while leaving the `@` off will only use the patterns on the explicit arguments.
* An alternation pattern `p1 | p2 | p3`, which matches an inductive type with multiple constructors,
  or a nested disjunction like `a ∨ b ∨ c`.

A pattern like `⟨a, b, c⟩ | ⟨d, e⟩` will do a split over the inductive datatype,
naming the first three parameters of the first constructor as `a,b,c` and the
first two of the second constructor `d,e`. If the list is not as long as the
number of arguments to the constructor or the number of constructors, the
remaining variables will be automatically named. If there are nested brackets
such as `⟨⟨a⟩, b | c⟩ | d` then these will cause more case splits as necessary.
If there are too many arguments, such as `⟨a, b, c⟩` for splitting on
`∃ x, ∃ y, p x`, then it will be treated as `⟨a, ⟨b, c⟩⟩`, splitting the last
parameter as necessary.

`rcases` also has special support for quotient types: quotient induction into Prop works like
matching on the constructor `quot.mk`.

`rcases h : e with PAT` will do the same as `rcases e with PAT` with the exception that an
assumption `h : e = PAT` will be added to the context.

Mathlib.Tactic.SlimCheck
`slim_check` considers a proof goal and tries to generate examples
that would contradict the statement.

Let's consider the following proof goal.

```lean
xs : List ℕ,
h : ∃ (x : ℕ) (H : x ∈ xs), x < 3
⊢ ∀ (y : ℕ), y ∈ xs → y < 5
```

The local constants will be reverted and an instance will be found for
`Testable (∀ (xs : List ℕ), (∃ x ∈ xs, x < 3) → (∀ y ∈ xs, y < 5))`.
The `Testable` instance is supported by an instance of `Sampleable (List ℕ)`,
`Decidable (x < 3)` and `Decidable (y < 5)`.

Examples will be created in ascending order of size (more or less)

The first counter-examples found will be printed and will result in an error:

```
===================
Found problems!
xs := [1, 28]
x := 1
y := 28
-------------------
```

If `slim_check` successfully tests 100 examples, it acts like
admit. If it gives up or finds a counter-example, it reports an error.

For more information on writing your own `Sampleable` and `Testable`
instances, see `Testing.SlimCheck.Testable`.

Optional arguments given with `slim_check (config : { ... })`

push_cast
Parser.Tactic.pushCast
Init.Tactics
`push_cast` rewrites the goal to move certain coercions (*casts*) inward, toward the leaf nodes.
This uses `norm_cast` lemmas in the forward direction.
For example, `↑(a + b)` will be written to `↑a + ↑b`.
- `push_cast` moves casts inward in the goal.
- `push_cast at h` moves casts inward in the hypothesis `h`.
It can be used with extra simp lemmas with, for example, `push_cast [Int.add_zero]`.

Example:
```lean
example (a b : Nat)
    (h1 : ((a + b : Nat) : Int) = 10)
    (h2 : ((a + b + 0 : Nat) : Int) = 10) :
    ((a + b : Nat) : Int) = 10 := by

linarith
linarith
Mathlib.Tactic.Linarith.Frontend
`linarith` attempts to find a contradiction between hypotheses that are linear (in)equalities.
Equivalently, it can prove a linear inequality by assuming its negation and proving `False`.

In theory, `linarith` should prove any goal that is true in the theory of linear arithmetic over
the rationals. While there is some special handling for non-dense orders like `Nat` and `Int`,
this tactic is not complete for these theories and will not prove every true goal. It will solve
goals over arbitrary types that instantiate `LinearOrderedCommRing`.

An example:
```lean
example (x y z : ℚ) (h1 : 2*x < 3*y) (h2 : -4*x + 2*z < 0)
        (h3 : 12*y - 4* z < 0)  : False := by
  linarith
```

`linarith` will use all appropriate hypotheses and the negation of the goal, if applicable.
Disequality hypotheses require case splitting and are not normally considered
(see the `splitNe` option below).

`linarith [t1, t2, t3]` will additionally use proof terms `t1, t2, t3`.

`linarith only [h1, h2, h3, t1, t2, t3]` will use only the goal (if relevant), local hypotheses
`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, and proofs `t1`, `t2`, `t3`. It will ignore the rest of the local context.

`linarith!` will use a stronger reducibility setting to try to identify atoms. For example,
```lean
example (x : ℚ) : id x ≥ x := by
  linarith
```
will fail, because `linarith` will not identify `x` and `id x`. `linarith!` will.
This can sometimes be expensive.

`linarith (config := { .. })` takes a config object with five
optional arguments:
* `discharger` specifies a tactic to be used for reducing an algebraic equation in the
  proof stage. The default is `ring`. Other options include `simp` for basic
  problems.
* `transparency` controls how hard `linarith` will try to match atoms to each other. By default
  it will only unfold `reducible` definitions.
* If `splitHypotheses` is true, `linarith` will split conjunctions in the context into separate
  hypotheses.
* If `splitNe` is `true`, `linarith` will case split on disequality hypotheses.
  For a given `x ≠ y` hypothesis, `linarith` is run with both `x < y` and `x > y`,
  and so this runs linarith exponentially many times with respect to the number of
  disequality hypotheses. (`false` by default.)
* If `exfalso` is `false`, `linarith` will fail when the goal is neither an inequality nor `False`.
  (`true` by default.)
* `restrict_type` (not yet implemented in mathlib4)
  will only use hypotheses that are inequalities over `tp`. This is useful
  if you have e.g. both integer and rational valued inequalities in the local context, which can
  sometimes confuse the tactic.

A variant, `nlinarith`, does some basic preprocessing to handle some nonlinear goals.

The option `set_option trace.linarith true` will trace certain intermediate stages of the `linarith`
routine.

use
useSyntax
Mathlib.Tactic.Use
`use e₁, e₂, ⋯` is similar to `exists`, but unlike `exists` it is equivalent to applying the tactic
`refine ⟨e₁, e₂, ⋯, ?_, ⋯, ?_⟩` with any number of placeholders (rather than just one) and
then trying to close goals associated to the placeholders with a configurable discharger (rather
than just `try trivial`).

Examples:

```lean
example : ∃ x : Nat, x = x := by use 42

example : ∃ x : Nat, ∃ y : Nat, x = y := by use 42, 42

example : ∃ x : String × String, x.1 = x.2 := by use ("forty-two", "forty-two")
```

`use! e₁, e₂, ⋯` is similar but it applies constructors everywhere rather than just for
goals that correspond to the last argument of a constructor. This gives the effect that
nested constructors are being flattened out, with the supplied values being used along the
leaves and nodes of the tree of constructors.
With `use!` one can feed in each `42` one at a time:

```lean
example : ∃ p : Nat × Nat, p.1 = p.2 := by use! 42, 42

example : ∃ p : Nat × Nat, p.1 = p.2 := by use! (42, 42)
```

The second line makes use of the fact that `use!` tries refining with the argument before
applying a constructor. Also note that `use`/`use!` by default uses a tactic
called `use_discharger` to discharge goals, so `use! 42` will close the goal in this example since
`use_discharger` applies `rfl`, which as a consequence solves for the other `Nat` metavariable.

These tactics take an optional discharger to handle remaining explicit `Prop` constructor arguments.
By default it is `use (discharger := try with_reducible use_discharger) e₁, e₂, ⋯`.
To turn off the discharger and keep all goals, use `(discharger := skip)`.
To allow "heavy refls", use `(discharger := try use_discharger)`.

push_neg

Push negations into the conclusion of a hypothesis.
For instance, a hypothesis `h : ¬ ∀ x, ∃ y, x ≤ y` will be transformed by `push_neg at h` into
`h : ∃ x, ∀ y, y < x`. Variable names are conserved.
This tactic pushes negations inside expressions. For instance, given a hypothesis
```lean
h : ¬ ∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ x, |x - x₀| ≤ δ → |f x - y₀| ≤ ε)
```
writing `push_neg at h` will turn `h` into
```lean
h : ∃ ε, ε > 0 ∧ ∀ δ, δ > 0 → (∃ x, |x - x₀| ≤ δ ∧ ε < |f x - y₀|),
```
(The pretty printer does *not* use the abbreviations `∀ δ > 0` and `∃ ε > 0` but this issue
has nothing to do with `push_neg`).

Note that names are conserved by this tactic, contrary to what would happen with `simp`
using the relevant lemmas. One can also use this tactic at the goal using `push_neg`,
at every hypothesis and the goal using `push_neg at *` or at selected hypotheses and the goal
using say `push_neg at h h' ⊢` as usual.

This tactic has two modes: in standard mode, it transforms `¬(p ∧ q)` into `p → ¬q`, whereas in
distrib mode it produces `¬p ∨ ¬q`. To use distrib mode, use `set_option push_neg.use_distrib true`.

Batteries.Tactic.congrConfigWith
Batteries.Tactic.Congr
Apply congruence (recursively) to goals of the form `⊢ f as = f bs` and `⊢ HEq (f as) (f bs)`.
* `congr n` controls the depth of the recursive applications.
  This is useful when `congr` is too aggressive in breaking down the goal.
  For example, given `⊢ f (g (x + y)) = f (g (y + x))`,
  `congr` produces the goals `⊢ x = y` and `⊢ y = x`,
  while `congr 2` produces the intended `⊢ x + y = y + x`.
* If, at any point, a subgoal matches a hypothesis then the subgoal will be closed.
* You can use `congr with p (: n)?` to call `ext p (: n)?` to all subgoals generated by `congr`.
  For example, if the goal is `⊢ f '' s = g '' s` then `congr with x` generates the goal
  `x : α ⊢ f x = g x`.

hand sides, subsequent left-hand sides can be replaced with `_`.
```

```
It is also possible to write the *first* relation as `<lhs>\n  _ = <rhs> :=

identifiers:
```

congr!
Congr!.congr!
Mathlib.Tactic.Congr!
Equates pieces of the left-hand side of a goal to corresponding pieces of the right-hand side by
recursively applying congruence lemmas. For example, with `⊢ f as = g bs` we could get
two goals `⊢ f = g` and `⊢ as = bs`.

Syntax:
```
congr!
congr! n
congr! with x y z
congr! n with x y z
```
Here, `n` is a natural number and `x`, `y`, `z` are `rintro` patterns (like `h`, `rfl`, `⟨x, y⟩`,
`_`, `-`, `(h | h)`, etc.).

The `congr!` tactic is similar to `congr` but is more insistent in trying to equate left-hand sides
to right-hand sides of goals. Here is a list of things it can try:

- If `R` in `⊢ R x y` is a reflexive relation, it will convert the goal to `⊢ x = y` if possible.
  The list of reflexive relations is maintained using the `@[refl]` attribute.
  As a special case, `⊢ p ↔ q` is converted to `⊢ p = q` during congruence processing and then
  returned to `⊢ p ↔ q` form at the end.

- If there is a user congruence lemma associated to the goal (for instance, a `@[congr]`-tagged
  lemma applying to `⊢ List.map f xs = List.map g ys`), then it will use that.

- It uses a congruence lemma generator at least as capable as the one used by `congr` and `simp`.
  If there is a subexpression that can be rewritten by `simp`, then `congr!` should be able
  to generate an equality for it.

- It can do congruences of pi types using lemmas like `implies_congr` and `pi_congr`.

- Before applying congruences, it will run the `intros` tactic automatically.
  The introduced variables can be given names using a `with` clause.
  This helps when congruence lemmas provide additional assumptions in hypotheses.

- When there is an equality between functions, so long as at least one is obviously a lambda, we
  apply `funext` or `Function.hfunext`, which allows for congruence of lambda bodies.

- It can try to close goals using a few strategies, including checking
  definitional equality, trying to apply `Subsingleton.elim` or `proof_irrel_heq`, and using the
  `assumption` tactic.

The optional parameter is the depth of the recursive applications.
This is useful when `congr!` is too aggressive in breaking down the goal.
For example, given `⊢ f (g (x + y)) = f (g (y + x))`,
`congr!` produces the goals `⊢ x = y` and `⊢ y = x`,
while `congr! 2` produces the intended `⊢ x + y = y + x`.

The `congr!` tactic also takes a configuration option, for example
```lean
congr! (config := {transparency := .default}) 2
```
This overrides the default, which is to apply congruence lemmas at reducible transparency.

The `congr!` tactic is aggressive with equating two sides of everything. There is a predefined
configuration that uses a different strategy:
Try
```lean
congr! (config := .unfoldSameFun)
```
This only allows congruences between functions applications of definitionally equal functions,
and it applies congruence lemmas at default transparency (rather than just reducible).
This is somewhat like `congr`.

See `Congr!.Config` for all options.

You can use `apply_rules [-h]` to omit a local hypothesis.

`apply_rules` will also use `rfl`, `trivial`, `congrFun` and `congrArg`.
These can be disabled, as can local hypotheses, by using `apply_rules only [...]`.

You can use `apply_rules using [a₁, ...]` to use all lemmas which have been labelled
with the attributes `aᵢ` (these attributes must be created using `register_label_attr`).

You can pass a further configuration via the syntax `apply_rules (config := {...})`.
The options supported are the same as for `solve_by_elim` (and include all the options for `apply`).

`apply_rules` will try calling `symm` on hypotheses and `exfalso` on the goal as needed.
This can be disabled with `apply_rules (config := {symm := false, exfalso := false})`.

You can bound the iteration depth using the syntax `apply_rules (config := {maxDepth := n})`.

  If an `hᵢ` is a defined constant `f`, then the equational lemmas associated with
  `f` are used. This provides a convenient way to unfold `f`.
- `simp [*]` simplifies the main goal target using the lemmas tagged with the

- `simp at h₁ h₂ ... hₙ` simplifies the hypotheses `h₁ : T₁` ... `hₙ : Tₙ`. If
  the target or another hypothesis depends on `hᵢ`, a new simplified hypothesis
  `hᵢ` is introduced, but the old one remains in the local context.

field_simp
FieldSimp.fieldSimp
Mathlib.Tactic.FieldSimp
The goal of `field_simp` is to reduce an expression in a field to an expression of the form `n / d`
where neither `n` nor `d` contains any division symbol, just using the simplifier (with a carefully
crafted simpset named `field_simps`) to reduce the number of division symbols whenever possible by
iterating the following steps:

- write an inverse as a division
- in any product, move the division to the right
- if there are several divisions in a product, group them together at the end and write them as a
  single division
- reduce a sum to a common denominator

If the goal is an equality, this simpset will also clear the denominators, so that the proof
can normally be concluded by an application of `ring`.

`field_simp [hx, hy]` is a short form for
`simp (disch := field_simp_discharge) [-one_div, -one_divp, -mul_eq_zero, hx, hy, field_simps]`

Note that this naive algorithm will not try to detect common factors in denominators to reduce the
complexity of the resulting expression. Instead, it relies on the ability of `ring` to handle
complicated expressions in the next step.

As always with the simplifier, reduction steps will only be applied if the preconditions of the
lemmas can be checked. This means that proofs that denominators are nonzero should be included. The
fact that a product is nonzero when all factors are, and that a power of a nonzero number is
nonzero, are included in the simpset, but more complicated assertions (especially dealing with sums)
should be given explicitly. If your expression is not completely reduced by the simplifier
invocation, check the denominators of the resulting expression and provide proofs that they are
nonzero to enable further progress.

To check that denominators are nonzero, `field_simp` will look for facts in the context, and
will try to apply `norm_num` to close numerical goals.

The invocation of `field_simp` removes the lemma `one_div` from the simpset, as this lemma
works against the algorithm explained above. It also removes
`mul_eq_zero : x * y = 0 ↔ x = 0 ∨ y = 0`, as `norm_num` can not work on disjunctions to
close goals of the form `24 ≠ 0`, and replaces it with `mul_ne_zero : x ≠ 0 → y ≠ 0 → x * y ≠ 0`
creating two goals instead of a disjunction.

For example,
```lean
example (a b c d x y : ℂ) (hx : x ≠ 0) (hy : y ≠ 0) :
    a + b / x + c / x^2 + d / x^3 = a + x⁻¹ * (y * b / y + (d / x + c) / x) := by
  field_simp
  ring
```

Moreover, the `field_simp` tactic can also take care of inverses of units in
a general (commutative) monoid/ring and partial division `/ₚ`, see `Algebra.Group.Units`
for the definition. Analogue to the case above, the lemma `one_divp` is removed from the simpset
as this works against the algorithm. If you have objects with an `IsUnit x` instance like
`(x : R) (hx : IsUnit x)`, you should lift them with
`lift x to Rˣ using id hx; rw [IsUnit.unit_of_val_units] clear hx`
before using `field_simp`.

See also the `cancel_denoms` tactic, which tries to do a similar simplification for expressions
that have numerals in denominators.
The tactics are not related: `cancel_denoms` will only handle numeric denominators, and will try to
entirely remove (numeric) division from the expression by multiplying by a factor.

interval_cases
intervalCases
Mathlib.Tactic.IntervalCases
`interval_cases n` searches for upper and lower bounds on a variable `n`,
and if bounds are found,
splits into separate cases for each possible value of `n`.

after `interval_cases n`, the goals are `3 = 3 ∨ 3 = 4` and `4 = 3 ∨ 4 = 4`.

You can also explicitly specify a lower and upper bound to use,
as `interval_cases using hl, hu`.
The hypotheses should be in the form `hl : a ≤ n` and `hu : n < b`,
in which case `interval_cases` calls `fin_cases` on the resulting fact `n ∈ Set.Ico a b`.

generalize_proofs
generalizeProofsElab
Mathlib.Tactic.GeneralizeProofs
`generalize_proofs ids* [at locs]?` generalizes proofs in the current goal,
turning them into new local hypotheses.

- `generalize_proofs` generalizes proofs in the target.
- `generalize_proofs at h₁ h₂` generalized proofs in hypotheses `h₁` and `h₂`.
- `generalize_proofs at *` generalizes proofs in the entire local context.
- `generalize_proofs pf₁ pf₂ pf₃` uses names `pf₁`, `pf₂`, and `pf₃` for the generalized proofs.
  These can be `_` to not name proofs.

If a proof is already present in the local context, it will use that rather than create a new
local hypothesis.

When doing `generalize_proofs at h`, if `h` is a let binding, its value is cleared,
and furthermore if `h` duplicates a preceding local hypothesis then it is eliminated.

The tactic is able to abstract proofs from under binders, creating universally quantified
proofs in the local context.
To disable this, use `generalize_proofs (config := { abstract := false })`.
The tactic is also set to recursively abstract proofs from the types of the generalized proofs.
This can be controlled with the `maxDepth` configuration option,
with `generalize_proofs (config := { maxDepth := 0 })` turning this feature off.

For example:
```lean
example : List.nthLe [1, 2] 1 (by simp) = 2 := by
  -- ⊢ [1, 2].nthLe 1 ⋯ = 2
  generalize_proofs h
  -- h : 1 < [1, 2].length

It then moves `a` to the far right and `b` to the far left of each addition in which they appear.
The side to which the summands are moved is determined by the presence or absence of the arrow `←`.

The inputs `a, b,...` can be any terms, also with underscores.
The tactic uses the first "new" summand that unifies with each one of the given inputs.

There is a multiplicative variant, called `move_mul`.

There is also a general tactic for a "binary associative commutative operation": `move_oper`.
In this case the syntax requires providing first a term whose head symbol is the operation.

decide
Parser.Tactic.decide
Lean.Parser.Tactic
`decide` attempts to prove the main goal (with target type `p`) by synthesizing an instance of `Decidable p`
and then reducing that instance to evaluate the truth value of `p`.
If it reduces to `isTrue h`, then `h` is a proof of `p` that closes the goal.

Limitations:
- The target is not allowed to contain local variables or metavariables.
  If there are local variables, you can try first using the `revert` tactic with these local variables
  to move them into the target, which may allow `decide` to succeed.
- Because this uses kernel reduction to evaluate the term, `Decidable` instances defined
  by well-founded recursion might not work, because evaluating them requires reducing proofs.
  The kernel can also get stuck reducing `Decidable` instances with `Eq.rec` terms for rewriting propositions.
  These can appear for instances defined using tactics (such as `rw` and `simp`).
  To avoid this, use definitions such as `decidable_of_iff` instead.

## Examples

```lean
example : 2 + 2 ≠ 5 := by decide

Trying to prove a false proposition:

Mathlib.Tactic.ExtractLets
The `extract_lets at h` tactic takes a local hypothesis of the form `h : let x := v; b`

of as being a `cases` tactic for `let` expressions. It can also be thought of as being like
`intros at h` for `let` expressions.

For example, if `h : let x := 1; x = x`, then `extract_lets x at h` introduces `x : Nat := 1` and
changes `h` to `h : x = x`.

Just like `intros`, the `extract_lets` tactic either takes a list of names, in which case
that specifies the number of `let` bindings that must be extracted, or it takes no names, in which
case all the `let` bindings are extracted.

The tactic `extract_lets` (without `at`) or `extract_lets at h ⊢` acts as a weaker

  A variable is *relevant* if (1) it occurs in the target type, (2) there is a relevant variable
  that depends on it, or (3) the type of the variable is a proposition that depends on a
  relevant variable.

  If the target is `False`, then for convenience `extract_goal` includes all variables.
- `extract_goal *` formats the current goal without cleaning up the local context.
- `extract_goal a b c ...` formats the current goal after removing everything that the given
  variables `a`, `b`, `c`, ... do not depend on.
- `extract_goal ... using name` uses the name `name` for the theorem or definition rather than
  the autogenerated name.

The tactic tries to produce an output that can be copy-pasted and just work,
but its success depends on whether the expressions are amenable
to being unambiguously pretty printed.

The tactic responds to pretty printing options.
For example, `set_option pp.all true in extract_goal` gives the `pp.all` form.

This should be used with care because it adds the entire lean compiler to the trusted

this method or anything that transitively depends on them. Nevertheless, because it is

----help----
let
Parser.Tactic.tacticLet_
Init.Tactics
The `let` tactic is for adding definitions to the local context of the main goal.
* `let x : t := e` adds the definition `x : t := e` if `e` is a term of type `t`.
* `let x := e` uses the type of `e` for `t`.
* `let : t := e` and `let := e` use `this` for the name of the hypothesis.
* `let pat := e` for a pattern `pat` is equivalent to `match e with | pat => _`,
  where `_` stands for the tactics that follow this one.
  It is convenient for types that let only one applicable constructor.
  For example, given `p : α × β × γ`, `let ⟨x, y, z⟩ := p` produces the
  local variables `x : α`, `y : β`, and `z : γ`.

aesop
Aesop.Frontend.Parser.aesopTactic
Aesop.Frontend.Tactic
`aesop <clause>*` tries to solve the current goal by applying a set of rules
registered with the `@[aesop]` attribute. See [its
README](https://github.com/JLimperg/aesop#readme) for a tutorial and a
reference.

The variant `aesop?` prints the proof it found as a `Try this` suggestion.

Clauses can be used to customise the behaviour of an Aesop call. Available
clauses are:

- `(add <phase> <priority> <builder> <rule>)` adds a rule. `<phase>` is
  `unsafe`, `safe` or `norm`. `<priority>` is a percentage for unsafe rules and
  an integer for safe and norm rules. `<rule>` is the name of a declaration or
  local hypothesis. `<builder>` is the rule builder used to turn `<rule>` into
  an Aesop rule. Example: `(add unsafe 50% apply Or.inl)`.
- `(erase <rule>)` disables a globally registered Aesop rule. Example: `(erase
  Aesop.BuiltinRules.assumption)`.
- `(rule_sets := [<ruleset>,*])` enables or disables named sets of rules for
  this Aesop call. Example: `(rule_sets := [-builtin, MyRuleSet])`.
- `(config { <opt> := <value> })` adjusts Aesop's search options. See
  `Aesop.Options`.
- `(simp_config { <opt> := <value> })` adjusts options for Aesop's built-in
  `simp` rule. The given options are directly passed to `simp`. For example,
  `(simp_config := { zeta := false })` makes Aesop use
  `simp (config := { zeta := false })`.

choose!
Choose.tacticChoose!___Using_
Mathlib.Tactic.Choose
* `choose a b h h' using hyp` takes a hypothesis `hyp` of the form
  `∀ (x : X) (y : Y), ∃ (a : A) (b : B), P x y a b ∧ Q x y a b`
  for some `P Q : X → Y → A → B → Prop` and outputs
  into context a function `a : X → Y → A`, `b : X → Y → B` and two assumptions:
  `h : ∀ (x : X) (y : Y), P x y (a x y) (b x y)` and
  `h' : ∀ (x : X) (y : Y), Q x y (a x y) (b x y)`. It also works with dependent versions.

* `choose! a b h h' using hyp` does the same, except that it will remove dependency of
  the functions on propositional arguments if possible. For example if `Y` is a proposition
  and `A` and `B` are nonempty in the above example then we will instead get
  `a : X → A`, `b : X → B`, and the assumptions
  `h : ∀ (x : X) (y : Y), P x y (a x) (b x)` and
  `h' : ∀ (x : X) (y : Y), Q x y (a x) (b x)`.

The `using hyp` part can be omitted,
which will effectively cause `choose` to start with an `intro hyp`.

Examples:

```
example (h : ∀ n m : ℕ, ∃ i j, m = n + i ∨ m + j = n) : True := by
  choose i j h using h
  guard_hyp i : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ

injection
Parser.Tactic.injection
Init.Tactics
The `injection` tactic is based on the fact that constructors of inductive data
types are injections.
That means that if `c` is a constructor of an inductive datatype, and if `(c t₁)`
and `(c t₂)` are two terms that are equal then  `t₁` and `t₂` are equal too.
If `q` is a proof of a statement of conclusion `t₁ = t₂`, then injection applies
injectivity to derive the equality of all arguments of `t₁` and `t₂` placed in
the same positions. For example, from `(a::b) = (c::d)` we derive `a=c` and `b=d`.
To use this tactic `t₁` and `t₂` should be constructor applications of the same constructor.
Given `h : a::b = c::d`, the tactic `injection h` adds two new hypothesis with types
`a = c` and `b = d` to the main goal.
The tactic `injection h with h₁ h₂` uses the names `h₁` and `h₂` to name the new hypotheses.

reduce_mod_char!
ReduceModChar.reduce_mod_char!
Mathlib.Tactic.ReduceModChar
The tactic `reduce_mod_char` looks for numeric expressions in characteristic `p`

For example:
```
example : (5 : ZMod 4) = 1 := by reduce_mod_char
example : (X ^ 2 - 3 * X + 4 : (ZMod 4)[X]) = X ^ 2 + X := by reduce_mod_char
```

It also handles negation, turning it into multiplication by `p - 1`,
and similarly subtraction.

This tactic uses the type of the subexpression to figure out if it is indeed of positive
characteristic, for improved performance compared to trying to synthesise a `CharP` instance.
The variant `reduce_mod_char!` also tries to use `CharP R n` hypotheses in the context.
(Limitations of the typeclass system mean the tactic can't search for a `CharP R n` instance if
`n` is not yet known; use `have : CharP R n := inferInstance; reduce_mod_char!` as a workaround.)

congrm
congrM
Mathlib.Tactic.Congrm
`congrm e` is a tactic for proving goals of the form `lhs = rhs`, `lhs ↔ rhs`, `HEq lhs rhs`,
or `R lhs rhs` when `R` is a reflexive relation.
The expression `e` is a pattern containing placeholders `?_`,
and this pattern is matched against `lhs` and `rhs` simultaneously.
These placeholders generate new goals that state that corresponding subexpressions
in `lhs` and `rhs` are equal.
If the placeholders have names, such as `?m`, then the new goals are given tags with those names.

Examples:
```lean
example {a b c d : ℕ} :
    Nat.pred a.succ * (d + (c + a.pred)) = Nat.pred b.succ * (b + (c + d.pred)) := by
  congrm Nat.pred (Nat.succ ?h1) * (?h2 + ?h3)
  /-  Goals left:
  case h1 ⊢ a = b
  case h2 ⊢ d = b
  case h3 ⊢ c + a.pred = c + d.pred
  -/
  sorry
  sorry
  sorry

example {a b : ℕ} (h : a = b) : (fun y : ℕ => ∀ z, a + a = z) = (fun x => ∀ z, b + a = z) := by
  congrm fun x => ∀ w, ?_ + a = w
  -- ⊢ a = b
  exact h
```

The `congrm` command is a convenient frontend to `congr(...)` congruence quotations.
If the goal is an equality, `congrm e` is equivalent to `refine congr(e')` where `e'` is
built from `e` by replacing each placeholder `?m` by `$(?m)`.
The pattern `e` is allowed to contain `$(...)` expressions to immediately substitute
equality proofs into the congruence, just like for congruence quotations.

* If we have `h : a ≤ b`, then `apply_fun f at h` will replace this with `h : f a ≤ f b`,
  and create a subsidiary goal `Monotone f`.
  `apply_fun` will automatically attempt to discharge this subsidiary goal using `mono`,
  or an explicit solution can be provided with `apply_fun f at h using P`, where `P : Monotone f`.
* If we have `h : a < b`, then `apply_fun f at h` will replace this with `h : f a < f b`,
  and create a subsidiary goal `StrictMono f` and behaves as in the previous case.
* If we have `h : a ≠ b`, then `apply_fun f at h` will replace this with `h : f a ≠ f b`,
  and create a subsidiary goal `Injective f` and behaves as in the previous two cases.
* If the goal is `a ≠ b`, `apply_fun f` will replace this with `f a ≠ f b`.
* If the goal is `a = b`, `apply_fun f` will replace this with `f a = f b`,
  and create a subsidiary goal `injective f`.
  `apply_fun` will automatically attempt to discharge this subsidiary goal using local hypotheses,
  or if `f` is actually an `Equiv`,
  or an explicit solution can be provided with `apply_fun f using P`, where `P : Injective f`.
* If the goal is `a ≤ b` (or similarly for `a < b`), and `f` is actually an `OrderIso`,
  `apply_fun f` will replace the goal with `f a ≤ f b`.
  If `f` is anything else (e.g. just a function, or an `Equiv`), `apply_fun` will fail.

norm_cast
Parser.Tactic.tacticNorm_cast_
Init.Tactics
The `norm_cast` family of tactics is used to normalize certain coercions (*casts*) in expressions.
- `norm_cast` normalizes casts in the target.
- `norm_cast at h` normalizes casts in hypothesis `h`.

The tactic is basically a version of `simp` with a specific set of lemmas to move casts
upwards in the expression.
Therefore even in situations where non-terminal `simp` calls are discouraged (because of fragility),
`norm_cast` is considered to be safe.
It also has special handling of numerals.

For instance, given an assumption
```lean
a b : ℤ
h : ↑a + ↑b < (10 : ℚ)
```
writing `norm_cast at h` will turn `h` into
```lean
h : a + b < 10
```

There are also variants of basic tactics that use `norm_cast` to normalize expressions during
their operation, to make them more flexible about the expressions they accept
(we say that it is a tactic *modulo* the effects of `norm_cast`):
- `exact_mod_cast` for `exact` and `apply_mod_cast` for `apply`.
  Writing `exact_mod_cast h` and `apply_mod_cast h` will normalize casts
  in the goal and `h` before using `exact h` or `apply h`.
- `rw_mod_cast` for `rw`. It applies `norm_cast` between rewrites.
- `assumption_mod_cast` for `assumption`.
  This is effectively `norm_cast at *; assumption`, but more efficient.
  It normalizes casts in the goal and, for every hypothesis `h` in the context,

intros
Parser.Tactic.intros
Init.Tactics
Introduces zero or more hypotheses, optionally naming them.

- `intros` is equivalent to repeatedly applying `intro`
  until the goal is not an obvious candidate for `intro`, which is to say
  that so long as the goal is a `let` or a pi type (e.g. an implication, function, or universal quantifier),
  the `intros` tactic will introduce an anonymous hypothesis.
  This tactic does not unfold definitions.

- `intros x y ...` is equivalent to `intro x y ...`,
  introducing hypotheses for each supplied argument and unfolding definitions as necessary.
  Each argument can be either an identifier or a `_`.
  An identifier indicates a name to use for the corresponding introduced hypothesis,
  and a `_` indicates that the hypotheses should be introduced anonymously.

## Examples

Basic properties:
```lean
def AllEven (f : Nat → Nat) := ∀ n, f n % 2 = 0

-- Introduces the two obvious hypotheses automatically
example : ∀ (f : Nat → Nat), AllEven f → AllEven (fun k => f (k + 1)) := by
  intros
  /- Tactic state
     f✝ : Nat → Nat
     a✝ : AllEven f✝
     ⊢ AllEven fun k => f✝ (k + 1) -/
  sorry

-- Introduces exactly two hypotheses, naming only the first
example : ∀ (f : Nat → Nat), AllEven f → AllEven (fun k => f (k + 1)) := by
  intros g _
  /- Tactic state
     g : Nat → Nat
     a✝ : AllEven g
     ⊢ AllEven fun k => g (k + 1) -/
  sorry

-- Introduces exactly three hypotheses, which requires unfolding `AllEven`
example : ∀ (f : Nat → Nat), AllEven f → AllEven (fun k => f (k + 1)) := by
  intros f h n
  /- Tactic state
     f : Nat → Nat
     h : AllEven f
     n : Nat
     ⊢ (fun k => f (k + 1)) n % 2 = 0 -/
  apply h
```

Implications:
```lean
example (p q : Prop) : p → q → p := by
  intros
  /- Tactic state
     a✝¹ : p
     a✝ : q
     ⊢ p      -/
  assumption
```

```lean

     k✝ : Nat := 2
     ⊢ n✝ + k✝ = 3 -/

zify
Zify.zify
Mathlib.Tactic.Zify
The `zify` tactic is used to shift propositions from `Nat` to `Int`.
This is often useful since `Int` has well-behaved subtraction.
```
example (a b c x y z : Nat) (h : ¬ x*y*z < 0) : c < a + 3*b := by
  zify
  zify at h
  /-
  h : ¬↑x * ↑y * ↑z < 0
  ⊢ ↑c < ↑a + 3 * ↑b
  -/
```
`zify` can be given extra lemmas to use in simplification. This is especially useful in the
presence of nat subtraction: passing `≤` arguments will allow `push_cast` to do more work.
```
example (a b c : Nat) (h : a - b < c) (hab : b ≤ a) : false := by
  zify [hab] at h
  /- h : ↑a - ↑b < ↑c -/
```
`zify` makes use of the `@[zify_simps]` attribute to move propositions,
and the `push_cast` tactic to simplify the `Int`-valued expressions.
`zify` is in some sense dual to the `lift` tactic.
`lift (z : Int) to Nat` will change the type of an
integer `z` (in the supertype) to `Nat` (the subtype), given a proof that `z ≥ 0`;
propositions concerning `z` will still be over `Int`.
`zify` changes propositions about `Nat` (the subtype) to propositions about `Int` (the supertype),
without changing the type of any variable.

* `choose a b h h' using hyp` takes a hypothesis `hyp` of the form
  `∀ (x : X) (y : Y), ∃ (a : A) (b : B), P x y a b ∧ Q x y a b`
  for some `P Q : X → Y → A → B → Prop` and outputs
  into context a function `a : X → Y → A`, `b : X → Y → B` and two assumptions:
  `h : ∀ (x : X) (y : Y), P x y (a x y) (b x y)` and
  `h' : ∀ (x : X) (y : Y), Q x y (a x y) (b x y)`. It also works with dependent versions.

* `choose! a b h h' using hyp` does the same, except that it will remove dependency of
  the functions on propositional arguments if possible. For example if `Y` is a proposition
  and `A` and `B` are nonempty in the above example then we will instead get
  `a : X → A`, `b : X → B`, and the assumptions
  `h : ∀ (x : X) (y : Y), P x y (a x) (b x)` and
  `h' : ∀ (x : X) (y : Y), Q x y (a x) (b x)`.

The `using hyp` part can be omitted,
which will effectively cause `choose` to start with an `intro hyp`.

Examples:

```

convert
convert
Mathlib.Tactic.Convert
The `exact e` and `refine e` tactics require a term `e` whose type is
definitionally equal to the goal. `convert e` is similar to `refine e`,
but the type of `e` is not required to exactly match the
goal. Instead, new goals are created for differences between the type
of `e` and the goal using the same strategies as the `congr!` tactic.
For example, in the proof state

```lean
n : ℕ,
e : Prime (2 * n + 1)
⊢ Prime (n + n + 1)
```

the tactic `convert e using 2` will change the goal to

```lean
⊢ n + n = 2 * n
```

In this example, the new goal can be solved using `ring`.

The `using 2` indicates it should iterate the congruence algorithm up to two times,
where `convert e` would use an unrestricted number of iterations and lead to two
impossible goals: `⊢ HAdd.hAdd = HMul.hMul` and `⊢ n = 2`.

A variant configuration is `convert (config := .unfoldSameFun) e`, which only equates function
applications for the same function (while doing so at the higher `default` transparency).
This gives the same goal of `⊢ n + n = 2 * n` without needing `using 2`.

The `convert` tactic applies congruence lemmas eagerly before reducing,
therefore it can fail in cases where `exact` succeeds:
```lean
def p (n : ℕ) := True
example (h : p 0) : p 1 := by exact h -- succeeds
example (h : p 0) : p 1 := by convert h -- fails, with leftover goal `1 = 0`
```
Limiting the depth of recursion can help with this. For example, `convert h using 1` will work
in this case.

The syntax `convert ← e` will reverse the direction of the new goals
(producing `⊢ 2 * n = n + n` in this example).

Internally, `convert e` works by creating a new goal asserting that
the goal equals the type of `e`, then simplifying it using
`congr!`. The syntax `convert e using n` can be used to control the
depth of matching (like `congr! n`). In the example, `convert e using 1`
would produce a new goal `⊢ n + n + 1 = 2 * n + 1`.

Refer to the `congr!` tactic to understand the congruence operations. One of its many
features is that if `x y : t` and an instance `Subsingleton t` is in scope,
then any goals of the form `x = y` are solved automatically.

Like `congr!`, `convert` takes an optional `with` clause of `rintro` patterns,
for example `convert e using n with x y z`.

The `convert` tactic also takes a configuration option, for example
```lean
convert (config := {transparency := .default}) h
```
These are passed to `congr!`. See `Congr!.Config` for options.

linear_combination
LinearCombination.linearCombination
Mathlib.Tactic.LinearCombination
`linear_combination` attempts to simplify the target by creating a linear combination
  of a list of equalities and subtracting it from the target.
  The tactic will create a linear
  combination by adding the equalities together from left to right, so the order
  of the input hypotheses does matter.  If the `normalize` field of the
  configuration is set to false, then the tactic will simply set the user up to
  prove their target using the linear combination instead of normalizing the subtraction.

Note: The left and right sides of all the equalities should have the same
  type, and the coefficients should also have this type.  There must be
  instances of `Mul` and `AddGroup` for this type.

* The input `e` in `linear_combination e` is a linear combination of proofs of equalities,
  given as a sum/difference of coefficients multiplied by expressions.
  The coefficients may be arbitrary expressions.
  The expressions can be arbitrary proof terms proving equalities.
  Most commonly they are hypothesis names `h1, h2, ...`.
* `linear_combination (norm := tac) e` runs the "normalization tactic" `tac`
  on the subgoal(s) after constructing the linear combination.
  * The default normalization tactic is `ring1`, which closes the goal or fails.
  * To get a subgoal in the case that it is not immediately provable, use
    `ring_nf` as the normalization tactic.
  * To avoid normalization entirely, use `skip` as the normalization tactic.
* `linear_combination (exp := n) e` will take the goal to the `n`th power before subtracting the
  combination `e`. In other words, if the goal is `t1 = t2`, `linear_combination (exp := n) e`
  will change the goal to `(t1 - t2)^n = 0` before proceeding as above.
  This feature is not supported for `linear_combination2`.
* `linear_combination2 e` is the same as `linear_combination e` but it produces two
  subgoals instead of one: rather than proving that `(a - b) - (a' - b') = 0` where
  `a' = b'` is the linear combination from `e` and `a = b` is the goal,
  it instead attempts to prove `a = a'` and `b = b'`.
  Because it does not use subtraction, this form is applicable also to semirings.
  * Note that a goal which is provable by `linear_combination e` may not be provable
    by `linear_combination2 e`; in general you may need to add a coefficient to `e`
    to make both sides match, as in `linear_combination2 e + c`.
  * You can also reverse equalities using `← h`, so for example if `h₁ : a = b`
    then `2 * (← h)` is a proof of `2 * b = 2 * a`.

then uses it to make an `Inhabited α` instance.
If the target is a `Prop`, this is done constructively. Otherwise, it uses `Classical.choice`.

simp_all?
Parser.Tactic.simpAllTrace
Init.Tactics
`simp?` takes the same arguments as `simp`, but reports an equivalent call to `simp only`
that would be sufficient to close the goal. This is useful for reducing the size of the simp
set in a local invocation to speed up processing.
```
example (x : Nat) : (if True then x + 2 else 3) = x + 2 := by
  simp? -- prints "Try this: simp only [ite_true]"
```

This command can also be used in `simp_all` and `dsimp`.

rel
GCongr.«tacticRel[_]»
Mathlib.Tactic.GCongr.Core
The `rel` tactic applies "generalized congruence" rules to solve a relational goal by
"substitution".  For example,
```
example {a b x c d : ℝ} (h1 : a ≤ b) (h2 : c ≤ d) :
    x ^ 2 * a + c ≤ x ^ 2 * b + d := by
  rel [h1, h2]
```
In this example we "substitute" the hypotheses `a ≤ b` and `c ≤ d` into the LHS `x ^ 2 * a + c` of
the goal and obtain the RHS `x ^ 2 * b + d`, thus proving the goal.

The "generalized congruence" rules used are the library lemmas which have been tagged with the
attribute `@[gcongr]`.  For example, the first example constructs the proof term
```
add_le_add (mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left h1 (pow_bit0_nonneg x 1)) h2
```
using the generalized congruence lemmas `add_le_add` and `mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left`.  If there are
no applicable generalized congruence lemmas, the tactic fails.

The tactic attempts to discharge side goals to these "generalized congruence" lemmas (such as the
side goal `0 ≤ x ^ 2` in the above application of `mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left`) using the tactic
`gcongr_discharger`, which wraps `positivity` but can also be extended. If the side goals cannot
be discharged in this way, the tactic fails.

sorry
Parser.Tactic.tacticSorry
Init.Tactics
The `sorry` tactic closes the goal using `sorryAx`. This is intended for stubbing out incomplete
parts of a proof while still having a syntactically correct proof skeleton. Lean will give
a warning whenever a proof uses `sorry`, so you aren't likely to miss it, but
you can double check if a theorem depends on `sorry` by using
`#print axioms my_thm` and looking for `sorryAx` in the axiom list.

peel
Peel.peel
Mathlib.Tactic.Peel
Peels matching quantifiers off of a given term and the goal and introduces the relevant variables.

- `peel e` peels all quantifiers (at reducible transparency),
  using `this` for the name of the peeled hypothesis.
- `peel e with h` is `peel e` but names the peeled hypothesis `h`.
  If `h` is `_` then uses `this` for the name of the peeled hypothesis.
- `peel n e` peels `n` quantifiers (at default transparency).
- `peel n e with x y z ... h` peels `n` quantifiers, names the peeled hypothesis `h`,
  and uses `x`, `y`, `z`, and so on to name the introduced variables; these names may be `_`.
  If `h` is `_` then uses `this` for the name of the peeled hypothesis.
  The length of the list of variables does not need to equal `n`.
- `peel e with x₁ ... xₙ h` is `peel n e with x₁ ... xₙ h`.

There are also variants that apply to an iff in the goal:
- `peel n` peels `n` quantifiers in an iff.
- `peel with x₁ ... xₙ` peels `n` quantifiers in an iff and names them.

Given `p q : ℕ → Prop`, `h : ∀ x, p x`, and a goal `⊢ : ∀ x, q x`, the tactic `peel h with x h'`
will introduce `x : ℕ`, `h' : p x` into the context and the new goal will be `⊢ q x`. This works
with `∃`, as well as `∀ᶠ` and `∃ᶠ`, and it can even be applied to a sequence of quantifiers. Note
that this is a logically weaker setup, so using this tactic is not always feasible.

For a more complex example, given a hypothesis and a goal:
```
h : ∀ ε > (0 : ℝ), ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N, 1 / (n + 1 : ℝ) < ε
⊢ ∀ ε > (0 : ℝ), ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N, 1 / (n + 1 : ℝ) ≤ ε
```
(which differ only in `<`/`≤`), applying `peel h with ε hε N n hn h_peel` will yield a tactic state:
```
h : ∀ ε > (0 : ℝ), ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N, 1 / (n + 1 : ℝ) < ε
ε : ℝ
hε : 0 < ε
N n : ℕ
hn : N ≤ n
h_peel : 1 / (n + 1 : ℝ) < ε
⊢ 1 / (n + 1 : ℝ) ≤ ε
```
and the goal can be closed with `exact h_peel.le`.
Note that in this example, `h` and the goal are logically equivalent statements, but `peel`
*cannot* be immediately applied to show that the goal implies `h`.

In addition, `peel` supports goals of the form `(∀ x, p x) ↔ ∀ x, q x`, or likewise for any
other quantifier. In this case, there is no hypothesis or term to supply, but otherwise the syntax
is the same. So for such goals, the syntax is `peel 1` or `peel with x`, and after which the
resulting goal is `p x ↔ q x`. The `congr!` tactic can also be applied to goals of this form using
`congr! 1 with x`. While `congr!` applies congruence lemmas in general, `peel` can be relied upon
to only apply to outermost quantifiers.

Finally, the user may supply a term `e` via `... using e` in order to close the goal
immediately. In particular, `peel h using e` is equivalent to `peel h; exact e`. The `using` syntax
may be paired with any of the other features of `peel`.

This tactic works by repeatedly applying lemmas such as `forall_imp`, `Exists.imp`,
`Filter.Eventually.mp`, `Filter.Frequently.mp`, and `Filter.eventually_of_forall`.

solve_by_elim
Parser.Tactic.solveByElim
Init.Tactics
`solve_by_elim` calls `apply` on the main goal to find an assumption whose head matches
and then repeatedly calls `apply` on the generated subgoals until no subgoals remain,
performing at most `maxDepth` (defaults to 6) recursive steps.

`solve_by_elim` discharges the current goal or fails.

`solve_by_elim` performs backtracking if subgoals can not be solved.

By default, the assumptions passed to `apply` are the local context, `rfl`, `trivial`,
`congrFun` and `congrArg`.

The assumptions can be modified with similar syntax as for `simp`:
* `solve_by_elim [h₁, h₂, ..., hᵣ]` also applies the given expressions.
* `solve_by_elim only [h₁, h₂, ..., hᵣ]` does not include the local context,
  `rfl`, `trivial`, `congrFun`, or `congrArg` unless they are explicitly included.
* `solve_by_elim [-h₁, ... -hₙ]` removes the given local hypotheses.
* `solve_by_elim using [a₁, ...]` uses all lemmas which have been labelled
  with the attributes `aᵢ` (these attributes must be created using `register_label_attr`).

`solve_by_elim*` tries to solve all goals together, using backtracking if a solution for one goal
makes other goals impossible.
(Adding or removing local hypotheses may not be well-behaved when starting with multiple goals.)

Optional arguments passed via a configuration argument as `solve_by_elim (config := { ... })`
- `maxDepth`: number of attempts at discharging generated subgoals
- `symm`: adds all hypotheses derived by `symm` (defaults to `true`).
- `exfalso`: allow calling `exfalso` and trying again if `solve_by_elim` fails
  (defaults to `true`).
- `transparency`: change the transparency mode when calling `apply`. Defaults to `.default`,
  but it is often useful to change to `.reducible`,
  so semireducible definitions will not be unfolded when trying to apply a lemma.

See also the doc-comment for `Lean.Meta.Tactic.Backtrack.BacktrackConfig` for the options
`proc`, `suspend`, and `discharge` which allow further customization of `solve_by_elim`.
Both `apply_assumption` and `apply_rules` are implemented via these hooks.

ghost_calc
WittVector.Tactic.ghostCalc
Mathlib.RingTheory.WittVector.IsPoly
`ghost_calc` is a tactic for proving identities between polynomial functions.
Typically, when faced with a goal like
```lean
∀ (x y : 𝕎 R), verschiebung (x * frobenius y) = verschiebung x * y
```
you can
1. call `ghost_calc`
2. do a small amount of manual work -- maybe nothing, maybe `rintro`, etc
3. call `ghost_simp`

and this will close the goal.

`ghost_calc` cannot detect whether you are dealing with unary or binary polynomial functions.
You must give it arguments to determine this.
If you are proving a universally quantified goal like the above,
call `ghost_calc _ _`.
If the variables are introduced already, call `ghost_calc x y`.
In the unary case, use `ghost_calc _` or `ghost_calc x`.

`ghost_calc` is a light wrapper around type class inference.
All it does is apply the appropriate extensionality lemma and try to infer the resulting goals.
This is subtle and Lean's elaborator doesn't like it because of the HO unification involved,
so it is easier (and prettier) to put it in a tactic script.
